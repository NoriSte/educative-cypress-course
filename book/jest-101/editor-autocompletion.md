# Editor autocompletion

Some editors ([VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/), and others) uses type definition from TypeScript to show suggestion and autcompletion. These can be installed even if we use JavaScript in out tests (running `npm install @types/jest --save-dev`).
