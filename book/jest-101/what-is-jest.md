# What is Jest

[Jest](https://jestjs.io/) is a JavaScript Testing Framework that offer a set of tools that aim to make software testing simpler.

Jest includes a Test Runner (different from the [Cypress one](../opening-cypress.md#the-test-runner), but the concept is the same), a program that takes some code (provided by us), and some expectations about the result of running that code (also privided by us), when Jest executes our code it compares the result with our expectations to test that the program behave as we expect it to.

In case any result don't match its expectations, Jest raises an error to notify us about the problem, giving us a stacktrace and other useful informations to find and resolve the root cause of why the test is failing.
