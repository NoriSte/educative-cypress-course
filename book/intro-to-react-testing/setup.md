# Setup `crete-react-app`

[create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started) offert an out-of-the-box experience when using Jest and React, it's already configured to allow tests to be written in ES6 and use JSX

## Create the application

```
npx create-react-app react-testing
cd react-testing
```

## Run the tests

`npm test`

> note: projects createrd using `create-react-app` run Jest in watch mode by default when running `npm test`

when the Jest cli starts press `a` to run all tests

in this case `create-react-app` provides a single smoke that checks that the application renders into the DOM without crashing

> note: this is called a 'smoke test', a test where nothing in particular is being tested and we make sure that something is not noticeable broker (eg if there's not smoke odds are it is not burning ðŸ”¥)
