# What is `react-testing-library`

React Testing Library is a package that offers a set of utilities to makes testing React applications simple by enforcing good practices and offering a small but very powerful set of APIs. It leverages `dom-testing-library` and `react-dom/test-utils` under the hood and exposes APIs tailored to work with React components.

### Testing Library principles

> We try to only expose methods and utilities that encourage you to write tests that closely resemble how your web pages are used.

> Utilities are included in this project based on the following guiding principles:
>
> - If it relates to rendering components, then it should deal with DOM nodes rather than component instances, and it should not encourage dealing with component instances.
> - It should be generally useful for testing the application components in the way the user would use it. We are making some trade-offs here because we're using a computer and often a simulated browser environment, but in general, utilities should encourage tests that use the components the way they're intended to be used.
> - Utility implementations and APIs should be simple and flexible.
