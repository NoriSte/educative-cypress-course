# Conclusions

- reverse the way you look at testing

  - how could it help me?
  - how could write a test instead of making this check manually?

- example of boeing and CLR?

- e2e tests only gor happy paths

- e2e trsts are not so important

- At the end of our testing journey, you will think about E2E tests as "back-end tests".
