The cost of testing

- the complexity of the project increases, we add one more item to the existing toolchain, it's a problem just if there is not a shared (and appreciated) testing culture

- at the first time, testing could be a con instead of a pro, you could end up maintaining more on the tests than on your own code (start again)

- tests could give you a false confidence, and you blame them when a bug hits the final users

- testing requires a mind shift, but it's easy to get accustomized if the pros are clear

- you need more time. Experience will make you faster and faster but, at the beginning, you need more time

- testing must be part of the definition of done in your company or for your boss, otherwise it's harder to make them understand the testing process value

- you can think you are creating one more app to ba maintained (while the testing "app" is a soft one that allows you to maintain the main one)
