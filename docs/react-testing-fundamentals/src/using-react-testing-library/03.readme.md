## testing form errors, poor man TDD

- test username empty
- test submit should not fire
- not submitting if there are errors
- must use `queryByTestId` instead of `getByTestId` becuuse get throws is element is not found
- aren't we doint too much a single test?
  - we are testing a flow so there is no isolation
