(exmple: string.replace with single occurrence to replace) At the beginning it could sounds annoying but...\n\nbut the code does not do what we expect all the times, the tests allow us to find bugs and unexpected corner cases (example: string.replace with multiple occurrencies but without the g flag)\n\nwith the tests we fix some corner cases that, if underestimated, could lead to big headaches (example: array.length && array[0] in jsx that could print 0)\n\nthe tests do the same things you should do manully... but at a blazing speed!...\n\n... And, once written, they will do that forever in your place\n\nit's impossible to test everything manually everytime, incrementally written tests do!\n\nthe tests tell a story about our code, an easier to maintain story compared to documentation and comments. A good storytelling test suite could allow everyone to jump into a project easily (example: look for a good example)\n\nreplicating some states is pretty impossible without a made on purpose environment runner. Without it you end up adding some strange conditions, returns, default states, etc. that are not reliable and that you must remember to remove (example: input field default states, simulating axios return data). With the tests, you act from the outside instead of from the inside\n\nwith tests you prevent problems, you won't face it\n\nbecause you could have faced yourself what means to work with untested code... 😊\n\n\n"},"book/testing-advantages.html":{"url":"book/testing-advantages.html","title":"Testing advantages?

Writing the test some days after the code is useless, you have forgotten half of the choices you made (choices that you need to test)\n\na test fails is a good thing, really! Because it's preventing a regression! The important thing is that...\n\n... the tests must not fail for nothing. False negative tests are the worst ones, you do not why they fail and you stop trusting them\n\nobviously, the opposite is important too: the tests must fail if the app does not work, otherwise what are they testing?\n\nthe tests must be simple. Super simple. They must be simple to be read, simple to be understood, simple to changed. The tests must be an ally, a simple scripts that perform some checks in place of you. Complex and unclear tests are an enemy, you write some tests to allow yourself to refactor the code, you can not spend your time refactoring the tests too. Last but not least: debugging a failing test is way harder that debugging an application (example: write a test with lot of before hooks, variables outside the tests etc).\nThink twice before DRYing a test code. While testing, you need to change more less every line of code to simulate the different cases. Complex DRY increases the test complexity and makes you add a lot of conditions to the DRYed code. Wrong abstraction in tests costs more than wrong abstraction in your code. Avoid conditions too if you can, the test code must be straightforward\n\n\ncognitive load image https://github.com/goldbergyoni/javascript-testing-best-practices/blob/master/assets/headspace.png\n\nif the tests fail, they must give useful feedback. They must tell you what failed and why, without re-launching or debugging them (example: expect([1, 2, 3]).toHaveLength(3); instead of expect([1, 2, 3].length === 3).toBe(true);)\n\nthe tests must be deterministic: if you run them hundred times, the result must be the same. If they are not deterministic, you must think what influences them and how to write better tests (example: testing a unit based on date?)\n\ndeterminist tests means that you can not rely on their execution order. Otherwise, you have extremely brittle tests that need to be run in a specific order (example: a test based on the mutation of the previous test)\n\nthe tests must fail before you write the code and succeed when you have written the code. Otherwise, you can not be sure that the tests are testing your code and that is your code that get them pass. You could neither be sure you have sistematically replicated the bug. You risk to be have a useless test (example: Ste has an example of a coding challenge with a useless test)\n\nthe tests must be fast, as fast as possible. You can not sacrifice speed for reliability, but the speed is really important because the faster the tests are, the faster you have feeddback, the higher the chance you run them frequently, the sooner you discover regressions. Slow tests make you move your mind to another task, make you waste your time, make you hungry when they fail after a 30-minutes pipeline, and, sooner or later, they make you think about removing them... (example: jest/cypress clock management)\n\nskip and only are good friends (jest.todo too)\n\nnever do whitebox testing. You have to test APIs, contracts and behaviours, not internal details. You must test as the consumer, not as the developer (example: enzyme with state tests)\n\nas much as you can, you should avoid that the tests feil because of some slight code changes. Import constants (example: RTL acting on a button with an imported string)\n\nthe tests must be indipendent, they must not share the state (example: a shared variable)\n\nyou can not interact manually with the tests. It's easier when doing functional tests but it's a generic rule, the tests must not depend on human changes (example: clicking on a button in a functional test)\n\ndifferent test types provide different feedback (and cost), get used with that. Following the blackbox testing rule, an E2E test can not provide useful feedback for a single function, and a unit test can not tell you if your app works\n\ncode coverage helps us finding what we have not tested yet, it is not an end in itself (example: test without assertions just to increase the coverage)\n\nE2E tests are not so important, they need the whole stack and they give too much generic feedback. They check the whole system, it's true, but thay are super brittle, so forget about their importance (TODO: move this part where speaking about e2e tests)\n\nif you're not enough confident about your application, think twice about your tests. Why they do not give you enough confidence? How could you improve them?

It checks everything: from the user interactions (one of the \"end\") to the business data (the other \"end\"): everything must work as designed.\nE2E tests are typically slow because:\n\nthey need a working back-end application. You can not launch the E2E tests without a server so you, as a front-end developer, depend on the back-end developers and infrastructure to work.\n\nThe back-end could be:\n\nlaunched alongside the front-end application. A mirror of the back-end is up and running, typically in a Docker container, the database is empty and you need to seed it with the data that you need in order to replicate the various scenario\nexists externally from the container where the tests are run. The data could already exist in the database but you need to get them pristine before every test, because the tests need always the same data to be effective\n\n\nthey depend on the resources the back-end can leverage.

And JQuery surely improves both the simplicity and productivity.\nWhat about the following snippet\ncy.get(\".form-control\").then($els => {\n  cy.get($els[0]).type(\"Tester\");\n  cy.get($els[1]).type(\"user@realworld.io\");\n  cy.get($els[2]).type(\"mysupersecretpassword\");\n});\n\n\ncy.get(\".form-control\").then($els => ... is necessary because almost every Cypress command can be leveraged synchronously (we are going to learn why later)\n\n$els, like every JQuery selector, is an array containing all the DOM elements that respond to the given selector (.form-control)\n\ncy.get($els[]) select the element and .type(\"Tester\") types, as the user would do, into the input field\n\n\nThen, we can go ahead and click the buttons\nit(\"The happy path should work\", () => {\n  cy.visit(\"/register\");\n  cy.get(\".form-control\").then($els => {\n    cy.get($els[0]).type(\"Tester\");\n    cy.get($els[1]).type(\"user@realworld.io\");\n    cy.get($els[2]).type(\"mysupersecretpassword\");\n    cy.get(\"button\").click();\n    cy.contains(\"No articles are here\").should(\"be.visible\");\n  });\n});\n\n\ncy.get(\"button\").click() speaks for itself\n\n\"No articles are here... yet.\" is the string that the home pages shows when the signup flow ends.

You can try it changing the test code with the following changes:\nit(\"The happy path should work\", () => {\n+ cy.viewport(300, 300);\n  cy.visit(\"/register\");\n  cy.get(\".form-control\").then($els => {\n    cy.get($els[0]).type(\"Tester\");\n+   cy.pause();\n    cy.get($els[1]).type(\"user@realworld.io\");\n    cy.get($els[2]).type(\"mysupersecretpassword\");\n    cy.get(\"button\").click();\n    cy.contains(\"No articles are here\").should(\"be.visible\");\n  });\n});\n\n\ncy.viewport(300, 300) makes the window extremely small, even interacting with the first input element requires scrolling until it\n\ncy.pause(); pauses the test execution (you can restore it later with the \"play\" button at the top of the Test Runner)\n\n\nAs you can see, Cypress scrolled the page until the username input field is at the top of the page, almost the same thing that the user would do in order to fill it.\n\nThis is necessary because an E2E test needs to simulate, as much as it can, the exact user behavior.\nPlease note: automatic scrolling is a feature of almost every UI testing tool, it's not a Cypress-specific feature like the next ones.\nAutomatic waiting\nThis is a mind-blowing feature: did you notice that the test seems a synchronous flow? Think about what happens between a command and the next one:\ncy.visit(\"/register\");\n// what does \"visit\" mean? When is Cypress going to execute the next commands? Is JavaScript ready?\ncy.get(\".form-control\").then($els => {\n  cy.get($els[0]).type(\"Tester\");\n  // typing is an asynchronous task, when will the next task start?\n  cy.get($els[1]).type(\"user@realworld.io\");\n  cy.get($els[2]).type(\"mysupersecretpassword\");\n  cy.get(\"button\").click();\n  // the web app makes an AJAX call, a lot of time passes before the \"No articles are here\" text becomes visible\n  cy.contains(\"No articles are here\").should(\"be.visible\");\n});\n\nWell: in every UI test, everything is asynchronous. The JavaScript execution is asynchronous, the DOM update is asynchronous, the actions of the user are asynchronous... A synchronous approach is a failure by definition.\nMost of the existing browser automation tools (like Selenium or Puppeteer) force you to manually manage a lot of asynchronous situations, while Cypress is asynchronous at its core (read more about a detailed comparison with the Await, do not make your E2E tests sleep post). Cypress has been created with UI testing in mind.\nAutomatic waitings are so important because:\n\nthey allow you to do not care about a lot of asynchronous updates\n\nthey make the test as fast as possible, avoiding fixed (and slow, and brittle) test pauses (we are going to deepen the topic in the next chapters)\n\n\nAnswering the questions added as comments to the above snippet:\n\ncy.visit waits for the window dispatches the load event\n\nevent if typing is a \"long\" task (every letter is typed one by one) the next command is not executed until the typing ends\n\nCypress retries cy.contains, cy.get, and other commands by default. The commands have customizable timeout and when Cypress is not able to find the requested elements, they are retried until the elements are added to the page (or throw an error if the timeout is not respected). You can read everything about Cypress retry-ability in the official documentation\n\n\nTest Runner interactivity\nThe Test Runner shows you what's happening in the front-end application, every executed Cypress command, and the result of all the assertions. And it's interactive, too! Take a look at the following video\n\n\nit shows how the Test Runner allows you to \"time travel\" the various phases and check the state of the front-end before and after the execution of every command. As usual, take a look at the @Test Runner documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/test-runner.html#Running-Experiments) to discover more about it.\nTest code execution order\nThat's the weird thing you need to get used with Cypress. As we told in advance, every Cypress command is asynchronous by default. That means that Cypress executes the test code twice:\n\nthe first time Cypress executes the test code to read and queue all the commands it needs to execute\n\nthen Cypress loads the page, and executes, one by one, all the command previously queued\n\n\nEven the commands execution order is not what could seem at a first sight. Try changing the test code to\nit(\"The happy path should work\", () => {\n  cy.visit(\"/register\");\n  cy.get(\".form-control\").then($els => {\n    cy.get($els[0]).type(\"Tester\");\n    cy.get($els[1]).type(\"user@realworld.io\");\n    cy.get($els[2]).type(\"mysupersecretpassword\");\n-   cy.get(\"button\").click();\n-   cy.contains(\"No articles are here\").should(\"be.visible\");\n  });\n+ cy.get(\"button\").click();\n+ cy.contains(\"No articles are here\").should(\"be.visible\");\n});\n\nRun the test and you will see that nothing changes. That's because, independently from the nesting level, Cypress waits for the previous commands (like cy.get($els[2]).type(\"...\")) to be completed before running the next ones (like cy.get(\"button\").click();). This unique feature allows writing more readable tests.\nThe downside is that you can not leverage commands returning variables the way you expect. Something like\nconst button = cy.get(\"button\");\nbutton.click(); // nope\n\nwill not work as expected. Every Cypress command yields a value and you must .then() it to consume the value.\ncy.get(\"button\").then($button => button.click());\n// or simply\ncy.get(\"button\").click();\n\nthe latter is possible because every command is executed on the previous yielded value.\nLast but not least: commands can be chained on the cy object:\ncy.visit(\"/register\");\ncy.get(\".form-control\").then($els => {\n  cy.get($els[0]).type(\"Tester\");\n  cy.get($els[1]).type(\"user@realworld.io\");\n  cy.get($els[2]).type(\"mysupersecretpassword\");\n  cy.get(\"button\").click();\n  cy.contains(\"No articles are here\").should(\"be.visible\");\n});\n// is equivalent to\ncy.visit(\"/register\")\n  .get(\".form-control\").then($els => {\n    cy.get($els[0])\n      .type(\"Tester\")\n      .get($els[1])\n      .type(\"user@realworld.io\")\n      .get($els[2])\n      .type(\"mysupersecretpassword\")\n      .get(\"button\")\n      .click();\n  })\n  cy.contains(\"No articles are here\")\n    .should(\"be.visible\");\n\nYou can choose the syntax you're more comfortable with. Read more about the asynchronicity nature of Cypress in the official documentation.\n\np.s. out of curiosity: you can log the Cypress queued commands with a slight change to the code\n-it(\"The happy path should work\", () => {\n+it(\"The happy path should work\", function() {\n  cy.visit(\"/register\");\n  cy.get(\".form-control\").then($els => {\n    cy.get($els[0]).type(\"Tester\");\n    cy.get($els[1]).type(\"user@realworld.io\");\n    cy.get($els[2]).type(\"mysupersecretpassword\");\n    cy.get(\"button\").click();\n    cy.contains(\"No articles are here\").should(\"be.visible\");\n+   console.log(this.test.commands);\n  });\n});\n\nThat's the result\n\nread here why you need to use the standard function() {} syntax instead of the arrow function () => {} syntax.\n"},"book/e2e-test-defects-determinism.html":{"url":"book/e2e-test-defects-determinism.html","title":"Determinism","keywords":"","body":"Main E2E test defects\nDeterminism\nCome back to the very first signup E2E test\ncontext(\"Signup flow\", () => {\n  it(\"The happy path should work\", () => {\n    cy.visit(\"/register\");\n    cy.get(\".form-control\").then($els => {\n      cy.get($els[0]).type(\"Tester\");\n      cy.get($els[1]).type(\"user@realworld.io\");\n      cy.get($els[2]).type(\"mysupersecretpassword\");\n    });\n    cy.get(\"button\").click();\n    cy.contains(\"No articles are here\").should(\"be.visible\");\n  });\n});\n\nThis test has a lot of problems, first of all: it's not deterministic (its behavior is not the same every time we launch it). This limitation is obvious, even if the RealWorld database starts pristine, the test is going to succeed only once. The second time, the user will be already registered and the result will be different.\n\nThere are more solutions, we could:\n\nrandomize the username and the email to create a unique user for every test run\nPros: the test remains almost the same\nCons: can not think of any\n\nreset the whole DB after the test execution\nPros: the test uses always the same data\nCons: it could be a problem in case the tests are parallelized and it could be slow (it's one more AJAX call)\n\nmanually make a call to the \"delete user\" API\nPros: it clears only the data created by the test\nCons: a delete API could not be available (because the process could be not so simple) and it could be slow (it's one more AJAX call)\n\n\nPros and cons must always be evaluated by you, your back-end colleagues, the project, etc. but, for the sake of the RealWorld project, we leverage the first solution: randomizing the user:\nconst random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100000);\ncy.get($els[0]).type(`Tester${random}`);\ncy.get($els[1]).type(`user+${random}@realworld.io`);\n\nThis is enough to make the test succeed at every run.

The are tens of reasons that could make the test (or, better, the signup flow) fail, we try to list some of them:\n\nthe host does not work\nthe page does not respond\none of the input fields is not rendered\nthe button is not rendered\nthe button does not trigger the right Redux action\nthe AJAX call does not start\nthe AJAX call has the wrong request payload\nthe API does not work and it does not respond\nthe API returns the wrong payload\nthe functions that manage the authentication do not the expected job\nthe user already exists\neverything is managed correctly but the redirect to the home does not work\nthe home page does not show the \"No articles are here\" text\nthe home page shows a slight different message to the user, something like, \"Click on 'New Post' to add your first contribution\"\n\nThey are not all the possible ones but it's a starting list.\nImplementation details errors\nFirst of all, we need to remove some of the possible errors since the beginning. The following ones\n\nthe button does not trigger the right Redux action\nthe functions that manage the authentication do not do the expected job\n\ncould be listed in the so-called \"implementation details\". We're testing the whole front-end application from an outer perspective, not from an inner one. We are testing that the user signup works, not how the signup works.\nA more practical example: if you need to test that pushing the accelerator get the car move, you push the accelerator and you check that... the car move! If the accelerator is a wired or electronic one does not matter! You will test the connection between the accelerator and the engine with other types of test.\nRemember that the subject under test must be treated as a black box (see the testing rules). About the signup flow: we are not testing why the form component did not receive the right dispatch prop or why it does not call dispatch it. We are just checking that the form works and allows the user to register! Do the users care about Redux actions? No! They just want to register!\nError feedback\nImagine this scenario: you're working at a new feature. You have inadvertently broken the signup flow and you discover that as soon as you run the existing E2E tests. Tests can fail, it happens! Tests are not meant to be always green, they are meant to help us discover regressions as soon as possible! Apart from failing, what have we broken in the signup flow? Is the test useful to identify what we need to fix?\nTake a look at the feedback the Test Runner gives us for all the above-listed errors.\n\n\n\nError\nTest Runner feedback\nIs it useful?\n\n\n\n\n1. the host does not work\n\n✅\n\n\n2. the page does not respond\n\n⚠️\n\n\n3. one of the input fields is not rendered\n\n❌\n\n\n4. the button is not rendered\n\n✅️\n\n\nAll the remaining errors:6. the AJAX call does not start7. the AJAX call has the wrong request payload8. the API does not work and it does not respond9. the API returns the wrong payload11. the user already exists12. everything is managed correctly but the redirect to the home does not work13. the home page does not show the \"No articles are here\" text14. the home page shows a slight different message to the user\n\n❌\n\n\n\nTake the most useless two errors and inverting the comparison, do you think that the feedback on the first column allows you to understand what happened (the second column)? 🤔\n\n\n\nTest Runner feedback\nError\n\n\n\n\n\n3. one of the input fields is not rendered\n\n\n\nOne of 6. the AJAX call does not start7. the AJAX call has the wrong request payload8. the API does not work and it does not respond9. the API returns the wrong payload11. the user already exists12. everything is managed correctly but the redirect to the home does not work13. the home page does not show the \"No articles are here\" text14. the home page shows a slight different message to the user\n\n\n\nThe answert is obviously No. The errors in the table tell us nothing about what happened.\nStuff to do in case of failures\nIt's not only about utility but also about preventing useless and long debugging processes. How do you proceed when a test fails? Usually you:\n\nread the logs of the tests\n\nlook for the failing test and read the output error\n\nit the output speaks for itself you can fix the regression you introduces, otherwise, you open the test file\n\nidentify the failing test and you run only it  (if you have violated the \"tests must not share the state\" rule you are going to waste a lot of time at this step)\n\nre-run the test looking at the web app\n\nbased on the error\n\nif the error is a \"visual one\" (something not rendered etc.) you know where do you have to check 1\nIf the error is not visual one (wrong DOM selectors, wrong AJAX payloads, etc.) you need to open the DevTools, re-run the test, inspect the DOM or the network activities, etc. until you find the error itself\n\n\n\nIt's a ton of work! The test we're talking about is not helpful at all! It has no meaningful feedback and it requires you debugging it (remember: debugging a test is harder than debugging a standard script/app) on failure. These are the basis for test blaming, hate and exclusion. Always remember: if you are blaming the tests, you must stop and re-think them. Go ahead to re-think the E2E test.\n\nFootnotes:\n1: for visual errors, a look at the screenshots and videos that Cypress saves automatically could be enough.\n\n"},"book/dom-elements-selection.html":{"url":"book/dom-elements-selection.html","title":"data-testid","keywords":"","body":"data-testid\nWe managed to have a deterministic event test like the following\nFile: cypress/integration/examples/signup/signup-2.e2e.spec.js\n/// \n\ncontext(\"Signup flow\", () => {\n  it(\"The happy path should work\", () => {\n    cy.visit(\"/register\");\n    cy.get(\".form-control\").then($els => {\n      const random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100000);\n      cy.get($els[0]).type(`Tester${random}`);\n      cy.get($els[1]).type(`user+${random}@realworld.io`);\n      cy.get($els[2]).type(\"mysupersecretpassword\");\n    });\n    cy.get(\"button\").click();\n    cy.contains(\"No articles are here\", { timeout: 10000 }).should(\"be.visible\");\n  });\n});\n\nbut, as we've seen, one of the defects of the above test is its uselessness while something goes wrong by retrieving the elements to interact with.\n\n    \n\n\n\nThe HTML of the form is the following\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    Sign up\n  \n\n\nIf we want to avoid basing the test on the order, we can leverage\n\nthe type: text, email, and password\n\nthe placeholder\n\n\nThe test could become the following\ncontext(\"Signup flow\", () => {\n  it(\"The happy path should work\", () => {\n    cy.visit(\"/register\");\n-    cy.get(\".form-control\").then($els => {\n-      const random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100000);\n-      cy.get($els[0]).type(`Tester${random}`);\n-      cy.get($els[1]).type(`user+${random}@realworld.io`);\n-      cy.get($els[2]).type(\"mysupersecretpassword\");\n-    });\n+   const random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100000);\n+   cy.get(\"[type=text]\").type(`Tester${random}`);\n+   cy.get(\"[type=email]\").type(`user+${random}@realworld.io`);\n+   cy.get(\"[type=password]\").type(\"mysupersecretpassword\");\n    cy.get(\"button\").click();\n    cy.contains(\"No articles are here\", { timeout: 10000 }).should(\"be.visible\");\n  });\n});\n\nor, leveraging the placeholder\ncontext(\"Signup flow\", () => {\n  it(\"The happy path should work\", () => {\n    cy.visit(\"/register\");\n-    cy.get(\".form-control\").then($els => {\n-      const random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100000);\n-      cy.get($els[0]).type(`Tester${random}`);\n-      cy.get($els[1]).type(`user+${random}@realworld.io`);\n-      cy.get($els[2]).type(\"mysupersecretpassword\");\n-    });\n+   const random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100000);\n+   cy.get(\"[placeholder=Username]\").type(`Tester${random}`);\n+   cy.get(\"[placeholder=Email]\").type(`user+${random}@realworld.io`);\n+   cy.get(\"[placeholder=Password]\").type(\"mysupersecretpassword\");\n    cy.get(\"button\").click();\n    cy.contains(\"No articles are here\", { timeout: 10000 }).should(\"be.visible\");\n  });\n});\n\nBoth of them work as expected when everything is ok, but if the email input field is not rendered they allow us to understand what's wrong\n\n    \n\n\n    \n\n\nYou get the same feedback if you run Cypress through cypress run (most of the times you'll find broken tests in the terminal or reading the logs)\n\nWhat not to do\nForget for a while the RealWorld form, there are a ton of selectors we can use when finding DOM elements, but most of them could change because of different purposes (and then break the test inadvertently):\n\n\n\nSelector\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nclasses\nStyle\n\n\nids\nJavaScript\n\n\nHTML tags\nstandardization/SEO\n\n\ntype\nUser experience\n\n\nARIA attributes\nUser experience\n\n\n\nThese selectors do not have testing purposes, the more the tests use them, the more they're unstable. You could not blame yourself or a colleague of your when, after 20 minutes of watching the pipeline and debugging the app, you discover that the test broke because of a class is changed. The problem is not in the web app, the problem is in the test.\nYou need to use a dedicated attribute, one that will not change because of other needs, and this is data-testid (or data-test, or data-cy, etc.). No one is going to change a data-testid attribute, even if he/she does not know what it means.\nThe markup of the form must be changed with the new attribute\n\n  \n    \n-     \n+     \n    \n    \n-     \n+     \n    \n    \n-     \n+     \n    \n-   Sign up\n+   Sign up\n  \n\n\nand the test must be adapted too\ncontext(\"Signup flow\", () => {\n  it(\"The happy path should work\", () => {\n    cy.visit(\"/register\");\n    const random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100000);\n-   cy.get(\"[placeholder=Username]\").type(`Tester${random}`);\n-   cy.get(\"[placeholder=Email]\").type(`user+${random}@realworld.io`);\n-   cy.get(\"[placeholder=Password]\").type(\"mysupersecretpassword\");\n-   cy.get(\"button\").click();\n-   cy.contains(\"No articles are here\", { timeout: 10000 }).should(\"be.visible\");\n+   cy.get(\"[data-testid=username]\").type(`Tester${random}`);\n+   cy.get(\"[data-testid=email]\").type(`user+${random}@realworld.io`);\n+   cy.get(\"[data-testid=password]\").type(\"mysupersecretpassword\");\n+   cy.get(\"[data-testid=signup-button]\").click();\n+   cy.get(\"[data-testid=no-articles-here]\", { timeout: 10000 }).should(\"be.visible\");\n  });\n});\n\nThis way the test leverages dedicated attributes and selectors, ones that do not change for non-testing purposes.

We could:\n\nuse the within API to restrict the searching power of getByText\n\ncy.get(\"form\")\n  .within(() => cy.getByText(\"Sign up\"))\n  .click();\n\n\nleverage the selector option of getByText\n\ncy.getByText(\"Sign up\", { selector: \"button\" }).click();\n\n\nleverage the container option of getByText\n\ncy.get(\"form\")\n  .then(subject => cy.getByText(\"Sign up\", { container: subject }))\n  .click();\n\n\nselect the second element returned by the getAllByText API (insead of the getByText one)\n\ncy.getAllByText(\"Sign up\")\n  .then($el => $el[1])\n  .click();\n\n\nuse jQuery.grep (the jQuery version of array.find)\n\ncy.getAllByText(\"Sign up\")\n  .then($els => Cypress.$.grep($els, el => el.tagName.toLowerCase() === \"button\"))\n  .click();\n\nPlease note: Cypress automatically exposes jQuery through Cypress.$.\n\nThere is an important difference between how cy.contains and cy.getByText work:\n\ncy.contains retrieves DOM elements even without an exact match (cy.contains(\"No articles are here\") works)\ncy.getByText does not retrieve DOM elements without an exact match (cy.getByText(\"No articles are here\") does not work, you need to replace it with cy.getByText(\"No articles are here... yet.\"))\n\nUsing Testing Library, the test becomes the following\nFile: cypress/integration/examples/signup/signup-4.e2e.spec.js\n/// \n\ncontext(\"Signup flow\", () => {\n  it(\"The happy path should work\", () => {\n    cy.visit(\"/register\");\n    const random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100000);\n    cy.getByPlaceholderText(\"Username\").type(`Tester${random}`);\n    cy.getByPlaceholderText(\"Email\").type(`user+${random}@realworld.io`);\n    cy.getByPlaceholderText(\"Password\").type(\"mysupersecretpassword\");\n    cy.get(\"form\")\n      .within(() => cy.getByText(\"Sign up\"))\n      .click();\n    cy.getByText(\"No articles are here... yet.\", { timeout: 10000 }).should(\"be.visible\");\n  });\n});\n\n\n\n\n"},"book/app-constants.html":{"url":"book/app-constants.html","title":"Sharing app constants","keywords":"","body":"Sharing app constants\nWhen the app works but the tests fail, we have a false negative.
