And, once written, they will do that forever in your place\n\nit's impossible to test everything manually everytime, incrementally written tests do!\n\nthe tests tell a story about our code, an easier to maintain story compared to documentation and comments. A good storytelling test suite could allow everyone to jump into a project easily (example: look for a good example)\n\nreplicating some states is pretty impossible without a made on purpose environment runner.

Writing the test some days after the code is useless, you have forgotten half of the choices you made (choices that you need to test)\n\nthe tests must not fail for nothing. False negative tests are the worst ones, you do not why they fail and you stop trusting them\n\nobviously, the opposite is important too: the tests must fail if the app does not work, otherwise what are they testing?\n\nthe tests must be simple. Super simple. They must be simple to be read, simple to be understood, simple to changed. The tests must be an ally, a simple scripts that perform some checks in place of you. Complex and unclear tests are an enemy, you write some tests to allow yourself to refactor the code, you can not spend your time refactoring the tests too. Last but not least: debugging a failing test is way harder that debugging an application (example: write a test with lot of before hooks, variables outside the tests etc)\n\nif the tests fail, they must give useful feedback. They must tell you what failed and why, without re-launching or debugging them (example: expect([1, 2, 3]).toHaveLength(3); instead of expect([1, 2, 3].length === 3).toBe(true);)\n\nthe tests must be deterministic: if you run them hundred times, the result must be the same. If they are not deterministic, you must think what influences them and how to write better tests (example: testing a unit based on date?)\n\nthe tests must fail before you write the code and succeed when you have written the code. Otherwise, you can not be sure that the tests are testing your code and that is your code that get them pass. You risk to be have a useless test (example: Ste has an example of a coding challenge with a useless test)\n\nthe tests must be fast, as fast as possible. You can not sacrifice speed for reliability, but the speed is really important because the faster the tests are, the faster you have feeddback, the higher the chance you run them frequently, the sooner you discover regressions. Slow tests make you move your mind to another task, make you waste your time, make you hungry when they fail after a 30-minutes pipeline, and, sooner or later, they make you think about removing them... (example: jest/cypress clock management)\n\nskip and only are good friends (jest.todo too)\n\nnever do whitebox testing. You have to test APIs, contracts and behaviours, not internal details (example: enzyme with state tests)\n\nas much as you can, you should avoid that the tests feil because of some slight code changes. Import constants (example: RTL acting on a button with an imported string)\n\nthe tests must be indipendent, they must not share the state (example: a shared variable)\n\nyou can not interact manually with the tests. It's easier when doing functional tests but it's a generic rule, the tests must not depend on human changes (example: clicking on a button in a functional test)\n\ndifferent test types provide different feedback, get used with that. Following the blackbox testing rule, an E2E test can not provide useful feedback for a single function, and a unit test can not tell you if your app works\n\ncode coverage helps us finding what we have not tested yet, it is not an end in itself (example: test without assertions just to increase the coverage)\n\n\n"},"book/having-fun-while-testing.html":{"url":"book/having-fun-while-testing.html","title":"Having fun while testing TODO:","keywords":"","body":"Having fun while testing\nTODO:\n\ntesting allows you to learn, in two ways:\n\nwhen you start building an application with a new framework or library, you can not be sure that what you do today does not break what you did yesterday.
