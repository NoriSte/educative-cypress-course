And, once written, they will do that forever in your place\n\nit's impossible to test everything manually everytime, incrementally written tests do!\n\nthe tests tell a story about our code, an easier to maintain story compared to documentation and comments. A good storytelling test suite could allow everyone to jump into a project easily (example: look for a good example)\n\nreplicating some states is pretty impossible without a made on purpose environment runner. Without it you end up adding some strange conditions, returns, default states, etc. that are not reliable and that you must remember to remove (example: input field default states, simulating axios return data).

Writing the test some days after the code is useless, you have forgotten half of the choices you made (choices that you need to test)\n\na test fails is a good thing, really! Because it's preventing a regression! The important thing is that...\n\n... the tests must not fail for nothing. False negative tests are the worst ones, you do not why they fail and you stop trusting them\n\nobviously, the opposite is important too: the tests must fail if the app does not work, otherwise what are they testing?\n\nthe tests must be simple. Super simple. They must be simple to be read, simple to be understood, simple to changed. The tests must be an ally, a simple scripts that perform some checks in place of you. Complex and unclear tests are an enemy, you write some tests to allow yourself to refactor the code, you can not spend your time refactoring the tests too. Last but not least: debugging a failing test is way harder that debugging an application (example: write a test with lot of before hooks, variables outside the tests etc).\nThink twice before DRYing a test code. While testing, you need to change more less every line of code to simulate the different cases. Complex DRY increases the test complexity and makes you add a lot of conditions to the DRYed code. Wrong abstraction in tests costs more than wrong abstraction in your code. Avoid conditions too if you can, the test code must be straightforward\n\n\ncognitive load image https://github.com/goldbergyoni/javascript-testing-best-practices/blob/master/assets/headspace.png\n\nif the tests fail, they must give useful feedback. They must tell you what failed and why, without re-launching or debugging them (example: expect([1, 2, 3]).toHaveLength(3); instead of expect([1, 2, 3].length === 3).toBe(true);)\n\nthe tests must be deterministic: if you run them hundred times, the result must be the same. If they are not deterministic, you must think what influences them and how to write better tests (example: testing a unit based on date?)\n\nthe tests must fail before you write the code and succeed when you have written the code. Otherwise, you can not be sure that the tests are testing your code and that is your code that get them pass. You could neither be sure you have sistematically replicated the bug. You risk to be have a useless test (example: Ste has an example of a coding challenge with a useless test)\n\nthe tests must be fast, as fast as possible. You can not sacrifice speed for reliability, but the speed is really important because the faster the tests are, the faster you have feeddback, the higher the chance you run them frequently, the sooner you discover regressions. Slow tests make you move your mind to another task, make you waste your time, make you hungry when they fail after a 30-minutes pipeline, and, sooner or later, they make you think about removing them... (example: jest/cypress clock management)\n\nskip and only are good friends (jest.todo too)\n\nnever do whitebox testing. You have to test APIs, contracts and behaviours, not internal details. You must test as the consumer, not as the developer (example: enzyme with state tests)\n\nas much as you can, you should avoid that the tests feil because of some slight code changes. Import constants (example: RTL acting on a button with an imported string)\n\nthe tests must be indipendent, they must not share the state (example: a shared variable)\n\nyou can not interact manually with the tests. It's easier when doing functional tests but it's a generic rule, the tests must not depend on human changes (example: clicking on a button in a functional test)\n\ndifferent test types provide different feedback (and cost), get used with that. Following the blackbox testing rule, an E2E test can not provide useful feedback for a single function, and a unit test can not tell you if your app works\n\ncode coverage helps us finding what we have not tested yet, it is not an end in itself (example: test without assertions just to increase the coverage)\n\nE2E tests are not so important, they need the whole stack and they give too much generic feedback. They check the whole system, it's true, but thay are super brittle, so forget about their importance (TODO: move this part where speaking about e2e tests)\n\nif you're not enough confident about your application, think twice about your tests. Why they do not give you enough confidence? How could you improve them? (example: Ste while implementing the roles in the webapp setting all he old tests with admin users to avoid changing them)\n\n\n"},"book/having-fun-while-testing.html":{"url":"book/having-fun-while-testing.html","title":"Having fun while testing TODO:","keywords":"","body":"Having fun while testing\nTODO: transform this file into some slides\n\ntesting allows you to learn, in two ways:\n\nwhen you start building an application with a new framework or library, you can not be sure that what you do today does not break what you did yesterday.

Everything is new, the examples you are try to implement do not work, debugging a test could be hard...\nWe think that approaching a test suite from the bottom to the top does not help. Starting with some unit tests is easy because they're a pretty simple topic, but does not help you with deadlines, nor having a good confidence about your app.\nIt's harder to manage some functional/end-to-end tests but you have more fun and, above all, you have full confidence about your app. Even if you end up having a single end-to-end (E2E from now on), this single test is more useful than having hundreds of unit tests.\nStarting with the E2E tests does not only give you more confidence (and satisfaction, it's important too) but it let you understand in a while the limitations of the most confident, yet expensive, kind of tests.\nThat's why we teach this course following the opposite flow: from the top (E2E tests) to the bottom (unit tests).\nPlease note: every kind of test is important, but they serve a different purpose.
