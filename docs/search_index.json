There are tools and libraries that simplify the testing process but the learning curve can seem daunting.\n\n\"What’s the right way to start testing my web applications?\"\n\"It’s unclear what I'm supposed to test (and what not) and how to do it\"\n\"My current tests fail all the time and don't help me preventing new bugs\"\n\nDoes this sound familiar?\nThis course aims to provide basic information, principles and experience-based advices, to enter the world of testing methodologies.\nTesting your own web applications is much easier and more profitable than you might think. Even if some advances concepts and benefits may only become evident in the medium to long run this course serves the purpose to overcome the initial obstacles and understand how to take actions and leverage the benefits of testing immediatetely .\nDuring the day, we will see all the useful tests for a web-app developed with React, dealing with the typical cases we encounter on a daily basis. During this course we will teach you:\n\nThe basics and advantages of the main testing techniques applied to React\nHow to test your React components productively\nThe best practices to follow to write useful and lasting tests\nHow to test different user flows without a working back-end\nHow to write effective end-to-end tests (E2E)\nHow to integrate tests into development and Continuous Integration pipelines\n\nWe are going to use Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress and all their useful plugins to increase our daily productivity and test reliability.\nWe will alternate theoretical explanations with live coding sessions, at the end of the course the source code of all the exercises, the material used for explanations, and other in-depth materials will be made available.\nTopics:\n\nTest panorama\nWhat is an E2E test\nBrowser automation\nPros and cons of E2E tests vs UI integration tests\n\n\nCypress\nThe Test Runner\nAutomatic waitings\nAutomatic screenshots e videos\nAsynchronous execution\n\n\nCypress as your main development browser\nBest practices\nHow to identify DOM elements\nWaitings instead of pauses, what deterministic events are\nThe right use of the assertions\n\n\nWhy the tests must be as simple as possible\nUsefulness for all the team members\nNaming conventions and dedicated scripts\nMonitoring tests\n\n\nCypres advanced use\nCustom commands\n\n\nVisual Regression Testing for the whole web app\nContinuous Integration\nJest fundamentals\nWhat You will learn\nWhat is Jest\nSetup\nRunning Jest\nWhat is a Test Case\nWatch-mode\nValid file test names\nAdd Editor autocompletion\nBuilt-in Matchers\nCustom Matchers\nTesting Async Code\njsdom\nJest Lifecycle\nMock Functions\nMocking a module\nThe Expect object\nTimers\n\n\nThe many wait to test React\nIntro to React testing\nWhat You will learn\nSetup\nreact-dom-test-utils\nHooks and act\njest-dom\n\n\nReact Testing Library\nWhat You will learn\nWhat is React Testing Library\nWhy React Testing Library\nSetup React Testing Library\nRendering using React Testing Library\nUsing DOM testing library\nImplementing and Testing new features\nDealing with Context Providers\nTesting components using Redux\n\n\n\nAttendees\nThis course is for all the developers who have already worked with React but have not yet started, or have not yet succeeded in testing their React web applications. At the end of the course, you will be able to apply the fundamental principles of the test methodologies to understand what and how to test effectively.\nParticipation requirements\nTo participate it is necessary, or at least strongly recommended, that you already know the basic concepts behind React: JSX, the components, and their status, lifecycle events, user interaction management.\n"},"book/about-us.html":{"url":"book/about-us.html","title":"About us","keywords":"","body":"About us\nStefano Magni and Jaga Santagostino\n\n\nStefano Magni\nStefano is a front-end developer and Cypress ambassador.

Writing the test some days after the code is useless, you probably forgot half of the choices you made (choices that you need to test)\n\na failing test is a good thing, really! Because it has protected us from a regression! The important thing is that...\n\n... The tests should not fail for randomly. False-negative tests are the worst ones, you do not know why they fail and you stop trusting them\n\nobviously, the opposite is important too: tests must fail if the app does not work, otherwise, what are they testing?\n\ntests must be simple. Simple to be read, understood, and changed. Tests must be an ally, simple scripts that perform some checks for you. Complex and unclear tests are an enemy, you write some tests to allow yourself to refactor the code, you can not spend all your time refactoring the tests. And remember that... (read the Avoid Nesting when you're Testing article of Kent C. Dodds)\n\n... Debugging a failing test is way harder than debugging an application\n\ndo not DRY the test code too early. While testing, you need to change more or less every line of the test code to simulate the different cases. Applying DRY when not necessary increases the test complexity and makes you add a lot of conditions to the DRYed code\n\navoid conditional tests as much as you can, the test code must be straightforward\n\na failing test must give useful feedback. It must tell you what failed and why, without re-launching or debugging it\n\ntests must be deterministic: if you run them a hundred times, the result must be the same. If they are not deterministic, you must think about what influences them and how to write better tests\n\ndeterministic tests also mean that you should not rely on their execution order. Otherwise, you have extremely brittle tests that need to be run in a specific order\n\nthe test must fail before you write the code and succeed when you have written the code. Otherwise, you can not be sure that the test is testing your code and that is your code that gets it to succeed. If you are fixing a bug, you could neither be sure you have systematically reproduced it. You risk having a useless test and a false sense of confidence\n\ntests must be fast, as fast as possible. You should never sacrifice speed for reliability, but the speed is really important because the faster the tests are, the faster you have feedback, the higher the chance you run them frequently, the sooner you discover regressions. Slow tests make you move your mind to another task, make you waste your time, make you angry when they fail after a 30-minutes pipeline, and, sooner or later, You will start wondering about removing them...\n\nnever do white-box testing. You have to test APIs, contracts, and behaviors, not internal details. You must test as the consumer, not as the author (Testing Implementation Details by Kent C. Dodds)\n\ntests failing because of some slight code changes are fragile and should be avoided\n\ntests must be independent from each other, they must not share any state\n\nyou cannot manually interact with the tests. It's easier when doing functional tests but it's a generic rule, the tests must not depend on human changes\n\ndifferent test types provide different feedback and have different cost, get used with that. Following the black-box testing rule, an E2E test can not provide useful feedback for a single function, and a unit test can not tell you if your app works\n\ncode coverage helps us find what we have not tested yet, it is not an end in itself\n\nif you're not enough confident about your application (you are not sure that it works even if the tests pass), think twice about your tests. Why they do not give you enough confidence? How could you improve them?\n\ndon't underestimate skip and only test utilities, these are super useful to run a portion of the tests and remove unnecessary noise\n\nyou should not test external services, you should test how you consume them, not if they work or not\n\nyou should not test third party scripts and libraries\n\nyou should not test native APIs\n\nlast but not least: always remember that testing and TDD are two different things.

It checks everything: from the user interactions (one of the \"end\") to the business data (the other \"end\"): everything must work as designed.\nE2E tests are typically slow because:\n\nthey need a working back-end application. You can not launch the E2E tests without a server so you, as a front-end developer, depend on the back-end developers and infrastructure to work.\n\nThe back-end could be:\n\nlaunched alongside the front-end application. A mirror of the back-end is up and running, typically in a Docker container, the database is empty and you need to seed it with the data that you need in order to replicate the various scenario\nexists externally from the container where the tests are run. The data could already exist in the database but you need to get them pristine before every test, because the tests need always the same data to be effective\n\n\nthey depend on the resources the back-end can leverage. But it's common to have limited back-end resources for the non-production environment, for example\n\nthey depend on the network. Everything that could affect the network is going to affect the tests too\n\nthey need a lot of reliable data. The tests must be deterministic (do not forget about the testing rules) and so, they need always the same data\n\n\nAn important note: the front-end application is not deployed in advance and then tested. Instead, it needs to be built on the fly, launched (usually with Docker) and then, if the tests pass, the new front-end app is going to be deployed. That's how the CI/CD pipelines work.\nWhat flows should be tested E2E?\n\nthe Happy Path flows: you need to be sure that, at least, the users are able to complete the basic operations\n\neverything valuable for your business: happy path or not, test whatever your business cares about (prioritizing them, obviously)\n\neverything that breaks often: weak areas of the system must be checked too\n\n\nIn the next examples we are going to write some E2E tests and to understand why they are not feasible to be used as the only/main test type.

Please note that, as the documentation says:\n\nThe querying behavior of this command matches exactly how $(…) works in jQuery.\n\nIt sounds strange to leverage JQuery nowadays... But do not forget one of the testing rules: the test must be simple. The less code the test is made of, the more the test is readable and understandable. And JQuery surely improves both the simplicity and productivity.\nWhat about the following snippet\ncy.get(\".form-control\").then($els => {\n  cy.get($els[0]).type(\"Tester\");\n  cy.get($els[1]).type(\"user@realworld.io\");\n  cy.get($els[2]).type(\"mysupersecretpassword\");\n});\n\n\ncy.get(\".form-control\").then($els => ... is necessary because almost every Cypress command must be leveraged asynchronously (we are going to learn why with the Cypress waitings and execution order)\n\n$els, like every JQuery selector, is an array containing all the DOM elements that respond to the given selector (.form-control)\n\ncy.get($els[]) select the element and .type(\"Tester\") types, as the user would do, into the input field\n\n\nThen, we can go ahead and click the button\nit(\"The happy path should work\", () => {\n  cy.visit(\"/register\");\n  cy.get(\".form-control\").then($els => {\n    cy.get($els[0]).type(\"Tester\");\n    cy.get($els[1]).type(\"user@realworld.io\");\n    cy.get($els[2]).type(\"mysupersecretpassword\");\n    cy.get(\"button\").click();\n    cy.contains(\"No articles are here\").should(\"be.visible\");\n  });\n});\n\n\ncy.get(\"button\").click() speaks for itself\n\n\"No articles are here... yet.\" is the string that the home page shows when the signup flow ends.

Think about it as the proof that everything worked (while testing the signup flow, obviously)\n\n\n\n\nthe cy.contains() API gets the DOM element containing the text\n\ncy.contains(\"No articles are here\") gets the DOM element containing the text \"No articles are here\"\n\ncy.contains(\"No articles are here\").should(\"be.visible\"); asserts about the element itself. This is the end of our test, we want to be sure that the text is visible because it means that the test is finished, the signup flow has worked!

Think about what happens between a command and the next one:\ncy.visit(\"/register\");\n// what does \"visit\" mean? When is Cypress going to execute the next commands? Is JavaScript ready?\ncy.get(\".form-control\").then($els => {\n  cy.get($els[0]).type(\"Tester\");\n  // typing is an asynchronous task, when will the next task start?\n  cy.get($els[1]).type(\"user@realworld.io\");\n  cy.get($els[2]).type(\"mysupersecretpassword\");\n  cy.get(\"button\").click();\n  // the web app makes an AJAX call, a lot of time passes before the \"No articles are here\" text becomes visible\n  cy.contains(\"No articles are here\").should(\"be.visible\");\n});\n\nWell: in every UI test, everything is asynchronous. The JavaScript execution is asynchronous, the DOM update is asynchronous, the actions of the user are asynchronous... A synchronous approach is a failure by definition.\nMost of the existing browser automation tools (like Selenium or Puppeteer) force you to manually manage a lot of asynchronous situations, while Cypress is asynchronous at its core (read more about a detailed comparison with the Await, do not make your E2E tests sleep post). Cypress has been created with UI testing in mind.\nAutomatic waitings are so important because:\n\nthey allow you to do not care about a lot of asynchronous updates\n\nthey make the test as fast as possible, avoiding fixed (and slow, and brittle) test pauses (we are going to deepen the topic in the next chapters)\n\n\nAnswering the questions added as comments to the above snippet:\n\ncy.visit waits for the window dispatches the load event\n\nevent if typing is a \"long\" task (every letter is typed one by one) the next command is not executed until the typing ends\n\nCypress retries cy.contains, cy.get, and other commands by default. The commands have customizable timeout and when Cypress is not able to find the requested elements, they are retried until the elements are added to the page (or throw an error if the timeout is not respected). You can read everything about Cypress retry-ability in the official documentation\n\n\nTest Runner interactivity\nThe Test Runner shows you what's happening in the front-end application, every executed Cypress command, and the result of all the assertions. And it's interactive, too! Take a look at the following video\n\n\nit shows how the Test Runner allows you to \"time travel\" the various phases and check the state of the front-end before and after the execution of every command. As usual, take a look at the Test Runner documentation to discover more about it.\nTest code execution order\nThat's the weird thing you need to get used with Cypress. As we told in advance, every Cypress command is asynchronous by default. That means that Cypress executes the test code twice:\n\nthe first time Cypress executes the test code to read and queue all the commands it needs to execute\n\nthen Cypress loads the page, and executes, one by one, all the command previously queued\n\n\nEven the commands execution order is not what could seem at a first sight. Try changing the test code to\nit(\"The happy path should work\", () => {\n  cy.visit(\"/register\");\n  cy.get(\".form-control\").then($els => {\n    cy.get($els[0]).type(\"Tester\");\n    cy.get($els[1]).type(\"user@realworld.io\");\n    cy.get($els[2]).type(\"mysupersecretpassword\");\n-   cy.get(\"button\").click();\n-   cy.contains(\"No articles are here\").should(\"be.visible\");\n  });\n+ cy.get(\"button\").click();\n+ cy.contains(\"No articles are here\").should(\"be.visible\");\n});\n\nRun the test and you will see that nothing changes. That's because, independently from the nesting level, Cypress waits for the previous commands (like cy.get($els[2]).type(\"...\")) to be completed before running the next ones (like cy.get(\"button\").click();). This unique feature allows writing more readable tests.\nThe downside is that you can not leverage commands returning variables the way you expect. Something like\nconst button = cy.get(\"button\");\nbutton.click(); // nope\n\nwill not work as expected. Every Cypress command yields a value and you must .then() it to consume the value.\ncy.get(\"button\").then($button => button.click());\n// or simply\ncy.get(\"button\").click();\n\nthe latter is possible because every command is executed on the previous yielded value/subject.\nLast but not least: commands can be chained on the cy object:\ncy.visit(\"/register\");\ncy.get(\".form-control\").then($els => {\n  cy.get($els[0]).type(\"Tester\");\n  cy.get($els[1]).type(\"user@realworld.io\");\n  cy.get($els[2]).type(\"mysupersecretpassword\");\n  cy.get(\"button\").click();\n  cy.contains(\"No articles are here\").should(\"be.visible\");\n});\n// is equivalent to\ncy.visit(\"/register\")\n  .get(\".form-control\")\n  .then($els => {\n    cy.get($els[0])\n      .type(\"Tester\")\n      .get($els[1])\n      .type(\"user@realworld.io\")\n      .get($els[2])\n      .type(\"mysupersecretpassword\")\n      .get(\"button\")\n      .click();\n  });\ncy.contains(\"No articles are here\").should(\"be.visible\");\n\nYou can choose the syntax you're more comfortable with. Read more about the asynchronicity nature of Cypress in the official documentation.\n\np.s. out of curiosity: you can log the Cypress queued commands with a slight change to the code\n-it(\"The happy path should work\", () => {\n+it(\"The happy path should work\", function() {\n  cy.visit(\"/register\");\n  cy.get(\".form-control\").then($els => {\n    cy.get($els[0]).type(\"Tester\");\n    cy.get($els[1]).type(\"user@realworld.io\");\n    cy.get($els[2]).type(\"mysupersecretpassword\");\n    cy.get(\"button\").click();\n    cy.contains(\"No articles are here\").should(\"be.visible\");\n+   console.log(this.test.commands);\n  });\n});\n\nThat's the result\n\nread here why you need to use the standard function() {} syntax instead of the arrow function () => {} syntax.\nAuthor: Stefano Magni\n"},"book/e2e-test-defects-determinism.html":{"url":"book/e2e-test-defects-determinism.html","title":"Determinism","keywords":"","body":"Main E2E test defects\nDeterminism\nCome back to the very first signup E2E test\ncontext(\"Signup flow\", () => {\n  it(\"The happy path should work\", () => {\n    cy.visit(\"/register\");\n    cy.get(\".form-control\").then($els => {\n      cy.get($els[0]).type(\"Tester\");\n      cy.get($els[1]).type(\"user@realworld.io\");\n      cy.get($els[2]).type(\"mysupersecretpassword\");\n    });\n    cy.get(\"button\").click();\n    cy.contains(\"No articles are here\").should(\"be.visible\");\n  });\n});\n\nThis test has a lot of problems, first of all: it's not deterministic (its behavior is not the same every time we launch it).

The are tens of reasons that could make the test (or, better, the signup flow) fail, we try to list some of them:\n\nthe host does not work\nthe page does not respond\none of the input fields is not rendered\nthe button is not rendered\nthe button does not trigger the right Redux action\nthe AJAX call does not start\nthe AJAX call has the wrong request payload\nthe API does not work and it does not respond\nthe API returns the wrong payload\nthe functions that manage the authentication do not the expected job\nthe user already exists\neverything is managed correctly but the redirect to the home does not work\nthe home page does not show the \"No articles are here\" text\nthe home page shows a slight different message to the user, something like, \"Click on 'New Post' to add your first contribution\"\n\nThey are not all the possible ones but it's a starting list.\nImplementation details errors\nFirst of all, we need to remove some of the possible errors since the beginning. The following ones\n\nthe button does not trigger the right Redux action\nthe functions that manage the authentication do not do the expected job\n\ncould be listed in the so-called \"implementation details\". We're testing the whole front-end application from an outer perspective, not from an inner one. We are testing that the user signup works, not how the signup works (React is an implementation detail by Kent C. Dodds).\nA more practical example: if you need to test that pushing the accelerator get the car move, you push the accelerator and you check that... the car move! If the accelerator is a wired or electronic one does not matter! You will test the connection between the accelerator and the engine with other types of test.\nRemember that the subject under test must be treated as a black box (see the testing rules). About the signup flow: we are not testing why the form component do not receive the right dispatch prop or why it does not call it. We are just checking that the form works and allows the user to register! Do the users care about Redux actions? No! They just want to register!\nError feedback\nImagine this scenario: you're working at a new feature. You have inadvertently broken the signup flow and you discover that as soon as you run the existing E2E tests. Tests can fail, it happens! Tests are not meant to be always green, they are meant to help us discover regressions as soon as possible! Apart from failing, what have we broken in the signup flow? Is the test useful to identify what we need to fix?\nTake a look at the feedback the Test Runner gives us for all the above-listed errors.\n\n\n\nError\nTest Runner feedback\nIs it useful?\n\n\n\n\n1. the host does not work\n\n✅\n\n\n2. the page does not respond\n\n⚠️\n\n\n3. one of the input fields is not rendered\n\n❌\n\n\n4. the button is not rendered\n\n✅️\n\n\nAll the remaining errors:6. the AJAX call does not start7. the AJAX call has the wrong request payload8. the API does not work and it does not respond9. the API returns the wrong payload11. the user already exists12. everything is managed correctly but the redirect to the home does not work13. the home page does not show the \"No articles are here\" text14. the home page shows a slight different message to the user\n\n❌\n\n\n\nTake the most useless two errors and inverting the comparison, do you think that the feedback on the first column allows you to understand what happened (the second column)? &#x1F914;\n\n\n\nTest Runner feedback\nError\n\n\n\n\n\n3. one of the input fields is not rendered\n\n\n\nOne of 6. the AJAX call does not start7. the AJAX call has the wrong request payload8. the API does not work and it does not respond9. the API returns the wrong payload11. the user already exists12. everything is managed correctly but the redirect to the home does not work13. the home page does not show the \"No articles are here\" text14. the home page shows a slight different message to the user\n\n\n\nThe answert is obviously No. The errors in the table tell us nothing about what happened.\nStuff to do in case of failures\nIt's not only about utility but also about preventing useless and long debugging processes. How do you proceed when a test fails? Usually you:\n\nread the logs of the tests\n\nlook for the failing test and read the output error\n\nit the output speaks for itself you can fix the regression you introduces, otherwise, you open the test file\n\nidentify the failing test and you run only it (if you have violated the \"tests must not share the state\" rule you are going to waste a lot of time at this step)\n\nre-run the test looking at the web app\n\nbased on the error\n\nif the error is a \"visual one\" (something not rendered etc.) you know where do you have to check 1\nIf the error is not visual one (wrong DOM selectors, wrong AJAX payloads, etc.) you need to open the DevTools, re-run the test, inspect the DOM or the network activities, etc. until you find the error itself\n\n\n\nIt's a ton of work! The test we're talking about is not helpful at all! It has no meaningful feedback and it requires you debugging it (remember: debugging a test is harder than debugging a standard script/app) on failure. These are the basis for test blaming, hate and exclusion. Always remember: if you are blaming the tests, you must stop and re-think them.

You could not blame yourself or a colleague of your when, after 20 minutes of watching the pipeline and debugging the app, you discover that the test broke because of a class is changed. The problem is not in the web app, the problem is in the test.\nYou need to use a dedicated attribute, one that will not change because of other needs, and this is data-testid (or data-test, or data-cy, etc.).

Dodds (and if you have not, do not worry, you are in the right place). Without anticipating too much, Testing Library is based on the assumption that the tests must consume the web app the same way the consumer does.\nWhat does it mean? Well, try thinking about how your users consume a web app: they look for contents, labels, placeholders, buttons, etc. to interact with them. They do not care about selectors, they care about contents. And if the users cannot find the elements through meaningful contents, they are not able to use the application and there are big UX problems.

What are the constants used by the actual test?\nFile: cypress/integration/examples/signup/signup-4-cypress-testing-library.e2e.spec.js\n/// \n\ncontext(\"Signup flow\", () => {\n  it(\"The happy path should work\", () => {\n    cy.visit(\"/register\");\n    const random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100000);\n    cy.findByPlaceholderText(\"Username\").type(`Tester${random}`);\n    cy.findByPlaceholderText(\"Email\").type(`user+${random}@realworld.io`);\n    cy.findByPlaceholderText(\"Password\").type(\"mysupersecretpassword\");\n    cy.get(\"form\")\n      .within(() => cy.findByText(\"Sign up\"))\n      .click();\n    cy.findByText(\"No articles are here... yet.\", { timeout: 10000 }).should(\"be.visible\");\n  });\n});\n\nThe route and all the contents\n\n\"/register\"\n\"Username\"\n\"Email\"\n\"Password\"\n\"Sign up\"\n\"No articles are here... yet.\"\n\ncould change because of a lot of reasons.

We \"fixed\" the DOM-related ones by retrieving the elements based on the contents instead of the order, but there were a lot of problems related to the AJAX request itself. They were the following ones:\n\nthe AJAX call does not start\n\nthe AJAX call has the wrong request payload\n\nthe API does not work and it does not respond\n\nthe API returns the wrong payload\n\nthe user already exists\n\n\nThe test still does not help us with these errors. When it fails, we need to spend some time debugging what's happening in the web app (while it's under test) to discover that the issue was related to a wrong AJAX request... Do not despair, Cypress is here to improve the E2E testing experience!\nServer contract\nWhen we test the front-end of our web app, we need to consider it a closed block (blackbox testing) and we need to check how it interacts with the external world. We need to test the contracts between the front-end and all the involved entities. What are the contracts to be respected by the front-end app?\n\nfunctional contract with the user\n\npresentational contract with the user\n\ncontract with the server\n\n\nThe first one is the subject of the all the E2E tests, the second one is the subject for the visual regression tests, but we need to concentrate on the last one. A lot of times the front-end stops working because of a misaligned communication with the back-end.\nAJAX request waiting\nIf we know that an AJAX request happens systematically (it is going to happen every time) we need to consider it in our Cypress test. The signup flow is a good example. We are going to see what are the APIs that allow us to do that.\nFirst of all, we need to set up AJAX call interception:\nit(\"The happy path should work\", () => {\n+ cy.server();\n+ cy.route(\"POST\", \"**/api/users\");\n\n  cy.visit(paths.register);\n  // the rest of the test code\n});\n\n\ncy.server() tells Cypress to act as a proxy, intercepting and allowing to wait for AJAX requests\n\ncy.route tells Cypress to intercept some AJAX requests. We can use a lot of options to match precisely which AJAX request we want to intercept. cy.route(\"POST\", \"**/api/users\") tells Cypress to intercept every POST request to every URL that ends with **/api/users (the signup form makes a request to the http://localhost:3100/api/users, Cypress uses minimatch to take advantage of * and ** glob support).\n\n\nSecond: we need to set a Cypress alias to reference it later on\nit(\"The happy path should work\", () => {\n  cy.server();\n  cy.route(\"POST\", \"**/api/users\")\n+   .as(\"signup-request\");\n\n  cy.visit(paths.register);\n  // the rest of the test code\n});\n\nThird: we must \"wait\" the AJAX request triggered by the front-end app\nit(\"The happy path should work\", () => {\n  cy.server();\n  cy.route(\"POST\", \"**/api/users\")\n    .as(\"signup-request\");\n  cy.visit(paths.register);\n  // form filling code\n  cy.get(\"form\")\n    .within(() => cy.findByText(strings.signUp))\n    .click();\n+ cy.wait(\"@signup-request\");\n  cy.findByText(noArticles, { timeout: 10000 }).should(\"be.visible\");\n});\n\nWhat does \"waiting\" main for an AJAX request? Here we can see the advantages of automatic Cypress waitings mixed with AJAX requests management! By asking Cypress to cy.wait(\"@signup-request\");, it's going to wait up to 5 seconds for the front-end to start the request and up to 30 seconds for the back-end to fulfill the request (both of the timeouts are customizable).\nLast change: do you remember why did we add the custom timeout to the cy.findByText(noArticles, { timeout: 10000 }) call? We added it while speaking about the stability of the test because we faced the problem that cy.contain (later replaced by cy.findByText) sometimes failed because the AJAX request took too long (and the default cy.contain/cy.findByText timeout is 4000 milliseconds). Now we do not need it anymore because the cy.wait knows that an AJAX request could take a really long time!\n- cy.findByText(noArticles, { timeout: 10000 }).should(\"be.visible\");\n+ cy.findByText(noArticles).should(\"be.visible\");\n\nThat's all the changes we applied to the test\nit(\"The happy path should work\", () => {\n+ cy.server();\n+ cy.route(\"POST\", \"**/api/users\")\n+   .as(\"signup-request\");\n  cy.visit(paths.register);\n  const random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100000);\n  cy.findByPlaceholderText(strings.username).type(`Tester${random}`);\n  cy.findByPlaceholderText(strings.email).type(`user+${random}@realworld.io`);\n  cy.findByPlaceholderText(strings.password).type(\"mysupersecretpassword\");\n  cy.get(\"form\")\n    .within(() => cy.findByText(strings.signUp))\n    .click();\n+ cy.wait(\"@signup-request\");\n- cy.findByText(noArticles, { timeout: 10000 }).should(\"be.visible\");\n+ cy.findByText(noArticles).should(\"be.visible\");\n});\n\nand that's the test with some comments\nFile: cypress/integration/examples/signup/signup-6-ajax-request-waiting.e2e.spec.js\n/// \n\nimport { paths } from \"../../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/App\";\nimport { noArticles } from \"../../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/ArticleList\";\nimport { strings } from \"../../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/Register\";\n\ncontext(\"Signup flow\", () => {\n  it(\"The happy path should work\", () => {\n    // set up AJAX call interception\n    cy.server();\n    cy.route(\"POST\", \"**/api/users\").as(\"signup-request\");\n\n    cy.visit(paths.register);\n\n    // form filling\n    const random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100000);\n    cy.findByPlaceholderText(strings.username).type(`Tester${random}`);\n    cy.findByPlaceholderText(strings.email).type(`user+${random}@realworld.io`);\n    cy.findByPlaceholderText(strings.password).type(\"mysupersecretpassword\");\n\n    // form submit...\n    cy.get(\"form\")\n      .within(() => cy.findByText(strings.signUp))\n      .click();\n    // ... and AJAX call waiting\n    cy.wait(\"@signup-request\");\n\n    // end of the flow\n    cy.findByText(noArticles).should(\"be.visible\");\n  });\n});\n\nThe test is now way more robust because\n\nwe do not wait only for something that \"reflects\" the result of the AJAX request (the \"No articles are here\" string) but for the AJAX request itself\n\nwe do not wait up to a \"random\" (the previous {timeout: 10000}) amount of time but up to a longer time. 10 seconds could not be enough (if you have ever consumed some AWS Lambdas you know what I'm talking about) because of the back-end wakeup/caching times\n\n\nAuthor: Stefano Magni\n"},"book/payload-assertions.html":{"url":"book/payload-assertions.html","title":"Asserting on payloads","keywords":"","body":"Asserting on payloads\nHere we are again: before summing up all the improvements we made to the original test, we need to speak about AJAX payloads assertions. The original list of problems listed two possible errors related to payloads\n\nthe AJAX call has the wrong request payload\n\nthe API returns the wrong payload\n\n\nBoth of them could break the app without any meaningful feedback at the moment. Cypress provides us all the APIs to check them.\nFirst of all, the request payload looks like this (I found it inspecting the front-end requests)\n{\n  \"user\": {\n    \"username\": \"Tester92306\",\n    \"email\": \"user+92306@realworld.io\",\n    \"password\": \"mysupersecretpassword\"\n  }\n}\n\nand the response payload looks like the following\n{\n  \"user\": {\n    \"username\": \"tester92306\",\n    \"email\": \"user+92306@realworld.io\",\n    \"token\": \"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6IjVkNzA5NmY3MWM2YTQ5MDVjM2VhMGM3NSIsInVzZXJuYW1lIjoidGVzdGVyOTIzMDYiLCJleHAiOjE1NzI4NDczNjcsImlhdCI6MTU2NzY1OTc2N30.uT9qGkT4FPCHwkV2A_7rbRFb_YqJN3cyncdbKOC3xNY\"\n  }\n}\n\nWe note that:\n\nthe username property are the same but the second one is converted to lower case\n\nthe email is obviously the same\n\nthe token is a string that changes everytime\n\n\nAsserting about them means checking that:\n\nthe request payload contains a user object that contains the data used to fill the form\n\nthe response payload contains both the email and the username, the token is a string that's 200-210 characters long (it's a JSON Web Token)\n\n\nDo we need to verify the token is syntactically correct?\n\nThe right question is: does the front-end app parse and use it? Does the front-end break if the token is not valid? If the answer is Yes, assert about it! Otherwise, it's not necessary! Soft assertions (\"it's not empty\") do not cost but deep checks (decrypting it and checking the content) do not make sense if you think about how the front-end consumes it.\nStarting from the most recent test\nFile: cypress/integration/examples/signup/signup-6-ajax-request-waiting.e2e.spec.js\n/// \n\nimport { paths } from \"../../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/App\";\nimport { noArticles } from \"../../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/ArticleList\";\nimport { strings } from \"../../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/Register\";\n\ncontext(\"Signup flow\", () => {\n  it(\"The happy path should work\", () => {\n    // set up AJAX call interception\n    cy.server();\n    cy.route(\"POST\", \"**/api/users\").as(\"signup-request\");\n\n    cy.visit(paths.register);\n\n    // form filling\n    const random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100000);\n    cy.findByPlaceholderText(strings.username).type(`Tester${random}`);\n    cy.findByPlaceholderText(strings.email).type(`user+${random}@realworld.io`);\n    cy.findByPlaceholderText(strings.password).type(\"mysupersecretpassword\");\n\n    // form submit...\n    cy.get(\"form\")\n      .within(() => cy.findByText(strings.signUp))\n      .click();\n    // ... and AJAX call waiting\n    cy.wait(\"@signup-request\");\n\n    // end of the flow\n    cy.findByText(noArticles).should(\"be.visible\");\n  });\n});\n\nThe cy.wait(\"@signup-request\") call yields the whole XHR object. We can inspect its content doing\ncy.wait(\"@signup-request\").should(xhr => {\n  console.log(JSON.stringify(xhr));\n});\n\nthe result is the following\n{\n  \"xhr\": {\n    \"method\": \"POST\",\n    \"url\": \"http://localhost:3100/api/users\",\n    \"id\": \"xhr1737\"\n  },\n  \"id\": \"xhr1737\",\n  \"url\": \"http://localhost:3100/api/users\",\n  \"method\": \"POST\",\n  \"status\": 200,\n  \"statusMessage\": \"200 (OK)\",\n  \"request\": {\n    \"headers\": {\n      \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\"\n    },\n    \"body\": {\n      \"user\": {\n        \"username\": \"Tester6588\",\n        \"email\": \"user+6588@realworld.io\",\n        \"password\": \"mysupersecretpassword\"\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"response\": {\n    \"headers\": {\n      \"content-type\": \"application/json; charset=utf-8\"\n    },\n    \"body\": {\n      \"user\": {\n        \"username\": \"tester6588\",\n        \"email\": \"user+6588@realworld.io\",\n        \"token\": \"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6IjVkNzA5ZTIyMWM2YTQ5MDVjM2VhMGM3ZCIsInVzZXJuYW1lIjoidGVzdGVyNjU4OCIsImV4cCI6MTU3Mjg0OTIwMiwiaWF0IjoxNTY3NjYxNjAyfQ.neUhshavvhwEUd4Tjf5Wo2xrmKUSVVRMJmlZEhIRp8c\"\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"duration\": 1598\n}\n\nLet's assert about the payloads: we could chain assertions (the same we did with the .should(\"be.visible\") assertion) to the AJAX request waiting.

What I mean: I try to analyze the yielded subject for every line of code\ncy.wait(\"@signup-request\") // yields the whole `xhr` object\n  .its(\"request.body\") // yields `xhr.request.body`\n  .should(\"have.property\", \"user\") // yields `xhr.request.body.user`\n  .and(\"be.a\", \"object\") // (still) yields `xhr.request.body.user`\n  .should(\"have.property\", \"username\", user.username) // yields `xhr.request.body.user.username`\n  // ... how we can assert about `xhr.request.body.user.email`?\n  .and(\"have.property\", \"email\", user.email); // will fail because `xhr.request.body.user.username` does not have an `email` property\n\nAsserting directly on cy.wait(\"@signup-request\") will not work, that's why we need to take advantage of another assertion syntax, the following one\ncy.wait(\"@signup-request\").should(xhr => {\n  expect(xhr.request.body)\n    .to.have.property(\"user\")\n    .and.to.be.a(\"object\");\n  expect(xhr.request.body.user).to.have.property(\"username\", user.username);\n  expect(xhr.request.body.user).to.have.property(\"email\", user.email);\n});\n\nthis way you always have a reference the original xhr object and its data.

By default, Cypress forces you to not share the state between the tests and it makes sense because it's a huge anti-pattern. We need to transform the signup process into something usable by every test: a Cypress custom command.\nA Cypress Custom Command is a function that can be called from the global cy object. We are going to create a cy.signupV1() command to be run before every other test.\nThe steps needed to create a new Cypress custom command are the next:\n\ncreate a new file containing the code of the command itself into the cypress/support directory.

The most important ones for our exercise are:\n\nthe commands must be as simple as possible\n\nthe commands must be flexible and easily customizable\n\n\nThe former is respected because we are going to copy all the code from the just written signup-8-simpler-assertions.e2e.spec.js test. The latter leads us to ask a question: what could be changed with a global and reusable signup utility? Essentially, only the user data.\nThe command must accept the user data with the usual defaults if not provided\nCypress.Commands.add(\"signupV1\", ({ email, username, password } = {}) => {\n  const random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100000);\n  const user = {\n    username: username || `Tester${random}`,\n    email: email || `user+${random}@realworld.io`,\n    password: password || \"mysupersecretpassword\"\n  };\n\n  // The rest of the code...\n});\n\nThe rest of the code is 100% the same of the signup-8-simpler-assertions.e2e.spec.js test, the only changes are placed in the end:\n\na cy.server({ enable: false }); to restore the original cy.server behavior\n\na closing cy.then(() => user); so the data used to register the user can be consumed by chaining a command to the cy.signupV1() call\n\n\nThe whole code is the following:\nFile: cypress/support/signup/signup-v1.js\n/// \n\nimport { paths } from \"../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/App\";\nimport { noArticles } from \"../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/ArticleList\";\nimport { strings } from \"../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/Register\";\n\nCypress.Commands.add(\"signupV1\", ({ email, username, password } = {}) => {\n  const random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100000);\n  const user = {\n    username: username || `Tester${random}`,\n    email: email || `user+${random}@realworld.io`,\n    password: password || \"mysupersecretpassword\"\n  };\n\n  // set up AJAX call interception\n  cy.server();\n  cy.route(\"POST\", \"**/api/users\").as(\"signup-request\");\n\n  cy.visit(paths.register);\n\n  // form filling\n  cy.findByPlaceholderText(strings.username).type(user.username);\n  cy.findByPlaceholderText(strings.email).type(user.email);\n  cy.findByPlaceholderText(strings.password).type(user.password);\n\n  // form submit...\n  cy.get(\"form\")\n    .within(() => cy.findByText(strings.signUp))\n    .click();\n\n  // ... and AJAX call waiting\n  cy.wait(\"@signup-request\").should(xhr => {\n    expect(xhr.request.body).deep.equal({\n      user: {\n        username: user.username,\n        email: user.email,\n        password: user.password\n      }\n    });\n\n    expect(xhr.status).to.equal(200);\n\n    cy.wrap(xhr.response.body)\n      .should(\"have.property\", \"user\")\n      .and(\n        user =>\n          expect(user)\n            .to.have.property(\"token\")\n            .and.to.be.a(\"string\").and.not.to.be.empty\n      )\n      .and(\"deep.include\", {\n        username: user.username.toLowerCase(),\n        email: user.email\n      });\n  });\n\n  // end of the flow\n  cy.findByText(noArticles).should(\"be.visible\");\n\n  // restore the original cy.server behavior\n  cy.server({ enable: false });\n\n  cy.then(() => user);\n});\n\nand the test that leverages the custom command is:\ncontext(\"Whatever test\", () => {\n  it(\"Should leverage the custom registration command\", () => {\n    cy.signupV1();\n    cy.log(\"The user is now registered and authanticated\");\n    cy.findByText(\"New Post\").should(\"be.visible\");\n  });\n});\n\nPlease note that the new command is not a replacement for the signup tests.

Let's introduce the concept of App Actions. The same way we leveraged and talked about App Constants, App Actions are utilities exposed directly from the front-end application. Let's work on a signup App Action.\nIn the RealWorld app front-end app, the registration is managed by the Register.js component. In its constructor, you can find the following code\nthis.submitForm = (username, email, password) => ev => {\n  ev.preventDefault();\n  this.props.onSubmit(username, email, password);\n};\n\nthis.submitForm is the handler that we should trigger automatically from our custom command. We could do that exposing it globally\nthis.submitForm = (username, email, password) => ev => {\n  ev.preventDefault();\n  this.props.onSubmit(username, email, password);\n}\n+window.appActions = window.appActions || {};\n+window.appActions.signup = ({username, email, password}) => this.props.onSubmit(username, email, password);\n\nbut since polluting the global scope is not ideal and since we need it only when the application is under test, we could check the existence of the window.Cypress object before exposing it\nthis.submitForm = (username, email, password) => ev => {\n  ev.preventDefault();\n  this.props.onSubmit(username, email, password);\n}\n\n+if(window.Cypress) {\n  window.appActions = window.appActions || {};\n  window.appActions.signup = ({username, email, password}) => this.props.onSubmit(username, email, password);\n+}\n\nIf you think that adding fictitious code to the application is not a good idea, remember that:\n\na lot of times the source code is soiled with temporary code/conditions that allow you to manually test some particular conditions (network errors or the authenticated user)\n\nyou can easily remove the code leveraging Webpack replacing every window.Cypress occurrence with false and then removing the unused code the same way\n\ntest duration is more important because you are going to run the tests thousands of times\n\n\nWhat's the final goal of the window.appActions.signup app action? Simply, calling it from the Cypress test! We can now call it directly deleting the slow form filling. Starting from the code of the signup-v1.js test, the changes are the following\n-cy.findByPlaceholderText(strings.username).type(user.username);\n-cy.findByPlaceholderText(strings.email).type(user.email);\n-cy.findByPlaceholderText(strings.password).type(user.password);\n-cy.get(\"form\")\n- .within(() => cy.findByText(strings.signUp))\n- .click();\n+cy.window()\n+ .its(\"appActions\")\n+ .invoke(\"signup\", user);\n\nYou can find the whole code of the custom command into the signup-v2.js custom command\nFile: cypress/support/signup/signup-v2.js\n/// \n\nimport { paths } from \"../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/App\";\nimport { noArticles } from \"../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/ArticleList\";\n\nCypress.Commands.add(\"signupV2\", ({ email, username, password } = {}) => {\n  const random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100000);\n  const user = {\n    username: username || `Tester${random}`,\n    email: email || `user+${random}@realworld.io`,\n    password: password || \"mysupersecretpassword\"\n  };\n\n  // set up AJAX call interception\n  cy.server();\n  cy.route(\"POST\", \"**/api/users\").as(\"signup-request\");\n\n  cy.visit(paths.register);\n\n  cy.window()\n    .its(\"appActions\")\n    .invoke(\"signup\", user);\n\n  // ... and AJAX call waiting\n  cy.wait(\"@signup-request\").should(xhr => {\n    expect(xhr.request.body).deep.equal({\n      user: {\n        username: user.username,\n        email: user.email,\n        password: user.password\n      }\n    });\n\n    expect(xhr.status).to.equal(200);\n\n    cy.wrap(xhr.response.body)\n      .should(\"have.property\", \"user\")\n      .and(\n        user =>\n          expect(user)\n            .to.have.property(\"token\")\n            .and.to.be.a(\"string\").and.not.to.be.empty\n      )\n      .and(\"deep.include\", {\n        username: user.username.toLowerCase(),\n        email: user.email\n      });\n  });\n\n  // end of the flow\n  cy.findByText(noArticles).should(\"be.visible\");\n\n  // restore the original cy.server behavior\n  cy.server({ enable: false });\n\n  cy.then(() => user);\n});\n\nThe signupV2 custom command is used by the signup-command-2.e2e.spec.js test and the performance improvement is notable compared to the previous signup-command-1.e2e.spec.js one\n\n    \n\n\nAs you can see, there are no interactions with the form itself\n\n\nthat's how App Actions work, they're just test-related shortcuts to perform fast and safe operations.\nFast because:\n\nreaching the desired front-end state through the UI is a big and slow anti-pattern. If you take a look at the signup-command-1.e2e.spec.js test, form filling (performed by the signup-v1.js custom command) takes circa 1.5 seconds each time. We can not waste so much time for every test, what could happen when the test suite will count tens or hundreds of tests?\n\nSafe because:\n\nwe can unleash our imagination when we speak about testing performance improvements. We could apply every kind of esoteric solution but the truth is that a lot of them make the test harder to comprehend, to modify and less aligned with the front-end logic. App actions are clear and concise\n\nthere are no differences between the front-end code and test code, so there are not two different codes to be maintained\n\n\nApp Actions sometimes can not be used but the more we leverage them, the more robust and fast the tests are.\nPageObject\nJust for your information: PageObject is the common pattern used widely before the concept of App Actions borned. The problem with the PageObject pattern is that you create one more abstraction to manage that could lose its effectiveness in a while causing more problems than advantages. If you want to deepen the comparison between the two approaches you could read the Stop using Page Objects and Start using App Actions post.\n\nAuthor: Stefano Magni\n"},"book/sharing-authentication-state.html":{"url":"book/sharing-authentication-state.html","title":"Sharing authentication state","keywords":"","body":"Sharing authentication state\nWe know that the state must not be shared between subsequent tests because it's the reason #1 for brittle tests.

But if we only have to maintain test independence, we could write a custom command that registers a new user, store the user token and restore the token before the next step!\nOne thing at a time:\n\nthe RealWorld front-end stores the user token with a jwt local storage field\n\n\n    \n\n\n\nwe could copy it after the first registration (it can be accessed in Cypress with localStorage.jwt)\n\nthen, we can restore it for every future test (checking that the user is still valid and authenticated for the back-end)\n\n\nLet's write the cy.signupV3 custom command, starting from the cy.signupV2 command that's the following:\nFile: cypress/support/signup/signup-v2.js\n/// \n\nimport { paths } from \"../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/App\";\nimport { noArticles } from \"../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/ArticleList\";\n\nCypress.Commands.add(\"signupV2\", ({ email, username, password } = {}) => {\n  const random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100000);\n  const user = {\n    username: username || `Tester${random}`,\n    email: email || `user+${random}@realworld.io`,\n    password: password || \"mysupersecretpassword\"\n  };\n\n  // set up AJAX call interception\n  cy.server();\n  cy.route(\"POST\", \"**/api/users\").as(\"signup-request\");\n\n  cy.visit(paths.register);\n\n  cy.window()\n    .its(\"appActions\")\n    .invoke(\"signup\", user);\n\n  // ... and AJAX call waiting\n  cy.wait(\"@signup-request\").should(xhr => {\n    expect(xhr.request.body).deep.equal({\n      user: {\n        username: user.username,\n        email: user.email,\n        password: user.password\n      }\n    });\n\n    expect(xhr.status).to.equal(200);\n\n    cy.wrap(xhr.response.body)\n      .should(\"have.property\", \"user\")\n      .and(\n        user =>\n          expect(user)\n            .to.have.property(\"token\")\n            .and.to.be.a(\"string\").and.not.to.be.empty\n      )\n      .and(\"deep.include\", {\n        username: user.username.toLowerCase(),\n        email: user.email\n      });\n  });\n\n  // end of the flow\n  cy.findByText(noArticles).should(\"be.visible\");\n\n  // restore the original cy.server behavior\n  cy.server({ enable: false });\n\n  cy.then(() => user);\n});\n\ncy.gignupV3\nStoring the token\n/// \n\nimport { paths } from \"../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/App\";\nimport { noArticles } from \"../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/ArticleList\";\n\n+let previousUserData = {};\nCypress.Commands.add(\"signupV2\", ({ email, username, password } = {}) => {\n  // ... the command code...\n\n  cy\n+ // wait until the localStorage token is saved\n+   .wrap(localStorage)\n+   .its(\"jwt\")\n+   .should(jwt => expect(jwt).to.be.a(\"string\").and.not.to.be.empty)\n+   .then(jwt => {\n+     previousUserData = {\n+       jwt,\n+       username,\n+       email,\n+       password,\n+       user\n+     };\n+   })\n    .then(() => user);\n});\n\nWhat the new code does:\n\nwaits until the localStorage.jwt token is available, the front-end does not set it synchronously (or, better, you should get accustomed that nothing is synchronous with E2E tests). This waiting is made easy by the inner Cypress retry-ability that retries the previous command (unless it could potentially change the state of the application under test like a click could do) until the assertions pass.\n\nSo, the jwt retrieval (.its(\"jwt\")) is retried until the next assertion .should(jwt => expect(jwt).to.be.a(\"string\").and.not.to.be.empty) passes.\n\nonce the jwt token is set, it stores all the user data (the token, the parameters, and the new user object)\n\n\"returns\" the user object with .then(() => user). It's an asynchronous flow so it \"returns\" the object by chaining it\n\n\nInitial token check\n/// \n\nimport { paths } from \"../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/App\";\nimport { noArticles } from \"../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/ArticleList\";\n\nlet previousUserData = {};\n-Cypress.Commands.add(\"signupV2\", ({ email, username, password } = {}) => {\n+Cypress.Commands.add(\"signupV3\", ({ email, username, password, ignoreLocalStorage = false } = {}) => {\n+   let user;\n    // if the user data match the previous one\n+   if (!ignoreLocalStorage && previousUserData.jwt && previousUserData.email === email) {\n+     cy.log(\"signupV3: Authentication check ⚠️\");\n\n      // set the stored token\n+     localStorage.setItem(\"jwt\", previousUserData.jwt);\n\n+     cy.visit(\"/\")\n        // use the \"New Post\" string to detect if the user is authenticated or not\n+       .findByText(newPost)\n+       .then($el => $el.length !== 0)\n+       .then(userIsAuthenticated => {\n+         if (userIsAuthenticated) {\n+           cy.log(\"signupV3: Authentication check passed ✅\");\n+           user = previousUserData.user;\n+         } else {\n+           // removed the stored token\n+           localStorage.removeItem(\"jwt\");\n+         }\n+       });\n+   }\n\n+   cy.then(() => {\n+     if (user) {\n+       return user;\n+     }\n+     cy.log(\"signupV3: Authentication check failed ❌ a new user is going to be registered\");\n\n\n    // ... the rest of the command code...\n});\n\nStep by step:\n\nfirst of all, we need to check that the user and the \"previous\" user are the same. We could do so checking the cy.signup() parameters to understand what email the test wants to have registered. And we must check that a \"previous user\" exists\n\nif (previousUserData.jwt && previousUserData.email === email) {\n  // ...\n}\n\n\nthe special \"user restore\" capability must be optional, with a new ignoreLocalStorage option\n\nif (\n  !ignoreLocalStorage &&\n  previousUserData.jwt &&\n  previousUserData.email === email\n) {\n  // ...\n}\n\n\nthe previous user's token is set\n\nlocalStorage.setItem(\"jwt\", previousUserData.jwt);\n\n\nthen, we must check that the token is still valid for the back-end application. It should not be a problem (unless the tests last for hours) but you never know, test independence and stability must not be put at risk by a missing control. Obviously, this check must be performend from the user perspective, as we read in the cypress-testing-library chapter\n\ncy.visit(\"/\")\n  // use the \"New Post\" string to detect if the user is authenticated or not\n  .findByText(newPost)\n  .then($el => $el.length !== 0)\n  .then(userIsAuthenticated => {\n    // now you know if the user is authenticated or not\n  });\n\n\nif the user is authenticated that's ok, it he/she is not, we must restore the initial front-end state removing the jwt token\n\n.then(userIsAuthenticated => {\n  if (userIsAuthenticated) {\n    cy.log(\"signupV3: Authentication check passed ✅\");\n    user = previousUserData.user;\n  } else {\n    // removed the stored token\n    localStorage.removeItem(\"jwt\");\n  }\n\n\nlast but not least: the previous register flow must be skipped\n\nif (user) {\n  return user;\n}\n\nTake a look at the improvement in terms of test duration, we started from the original cy.signupV1 command\n\n    \n\n\nthen, we improved that with App Actions\n\n    \n\n\nand finally, we leveraged the previously registered user\n\n    \n\n\nYou find the whole command code below\nFile: cypress/support/signup/signup-v3.js\n/// \n\nimport { paths } from \"../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/App\";\nimport { noArticles } from \"../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/ArticleList\";\nimport { newPost } from \"../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/Header\";\n\nlet previousUserData = {};\n\nCypress.Commands.add(\n  \"signupV3\",\n  ({ email, username, password, ignoreLocalStorage = false } = {}) => {\n    let user;\n    // if the user data match the previous one\n    if (!ignoreLocalStorage && previousUserData.jwt && previousUserData.email === email) {\n      cy.log(\"signupV3: Authentication check ⚠️\");\n\n      // set the stored token\n      localStorage.setItem(\"jwt\", previousUserData.jwt);\n\n      cy.visit(\"/\")\n        // use the \"New Post\" string to detect if the user is authenticated or not\n        .findByText(newPost)\n        .then($el => $el.length !== 0)\n        .then(userIsAuthenticated => {\n          if (userIsAuthenticated) {\n            cy.log(\"signupV3: Authentication check passed ✅\");\n            user = previousUserData.user;\n          } else {\n            // removed the stored token\n            localStorage.removeItem(\"jwt\");\n          }\n        });\n    }\n\n    cy.then(() => {\n      if (user) {\n        return user;\n      }\n      cy.log(\"signupV3: Authentication check failed ❌ a new user is going to be registered\");\n\n      const random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100000);\n      user = {\n        username: username || `Tester${random}`,\n        email: email || `user+${random}@realworld.io`,\n        password: password || \"mysupersecretpassword\"\n      };\n\n      // set up AJAX call interception\n      cy.server();\n      cy.route(\"POST\", \"**/api/users\").as(\"signup-request\");\n\n      cy.visit(paths.register);\n\n      cy.window()\n        .its(\"appActions\")\n        .invoke(\"signup\", user);\n\n      // ... and AJAX call waiting\n      cy.wait(\"@signup-request\").should(xhr => {\n        expect(xhr.request.body).deep.equal({\n          user: {\n            username: user.username,\n            email: user.email,\n            password: user.password\n          }\n        });\n\n        expect(xhr.status).to.equal(200);\n\n        cy.wrap(xhr.response.body)\n          .should(\"have.property\", \"user\")\n          .and(\n            user =>\n              expect(user)\n                .to.have.property(\"token\")\n                .and.to.be.a(\"string\").and.not.to.be.empty\n          )\n          .and(\"deep.include\", {\n            username: user.username.toLowerCase(),\n            email: user.email\n          });\n      });\n\n      // end of the flow\n      cy.findByText(noArticles).should(\"be.visible\");\n\n      // restore the original cy.server behavior\n      cy.server({ enable: false });\n\n      // wait until the localStorage token is saved\n      cy.wrap(localStorage)\n        .its(\"jwt\")\n        .should(jwt => expect(jwt).to.be.a(\"string\").and.not.to.be.empty)\n        .then(jwt => {\n          previousUserData = {\n            jwt,\n            username,\n            email,\n            password,\n            user\n          };\n        })\n        .then(() => user);\n    });\n  }\n);\n\nRemember that you can implement shared utilities or the above flow the way you want, but always keep in mind that you must care as much as you can about test independency and test stability. Both of them are really important for a good testing experience, one that does not make you hate the test suite.\nWith the new cy.signupV3 custom command we are sure that:\n\nthe first user is registered as usual\n\nif it's possible, the test takes advantage of the previously registered user, saving precious seconds\n\nif something goes wrong and the back-end does not recognize the previous user, a new one is registered\n\n\nIn the end: every test that leverages the cy.signupV3 command gets a registered user, the fastest possible way.\nPlease note: the performance improvements vary for every application, we artificially slowed down the RealWorld for the sake of this course.\nAuthor: Stefano Magni\n"},"book/stubbing-the-backend.html":{"url":"book/stubbing-the-backend.html","title":"Stubbing the Back-end","keywords":"","body":"Stubbing the back-end\nWhat's the matter with E2E tests? Well, they:\n\nare slow: in the previous chapter we dedicated a lot of attention to reduce the test duration but we three/four/five seconds are still too much. It's not a good result because we run just a few tests but a front-end application requires a lot more tests\n\ndo not allow the front-ender to work without a back-ender: this is a huge limit. We all know that we can not count on all the infrastructure 24/7, nor on our devops/back-end colleagues. Often, the front-end development and the back-end one do not proceed side by side either\n\nthey make edge cases replication hard: if we work with real data, we are going to spend most of the time dealing with it with a 20-40% of the time remaining for the front-end tests themselves\n\n\nSo: E2E tests are not feasible for front-end testing. They are important, obviously, but we cannot rely on them too much. That's the reason why E2E testing is at the top of the testing pyramid, they give you the most amount of confidence but they are super expensive in terms of writing, maintenance, and stability.\nGoing down with the testing pyramid we can find the integration tests, a kind of tests where a part of the application is tested, a middle ground between E2E testing (whole front-end+back-end app) and unit testing (single unit/module test). Cypress allows us to write \"one more\" type of test easily: UI Integration Tests. The goal is to test the whole front-end app but without a real back-end. All the AJAX requests are stubbed with static responses. The main advantages are:\n\nextreme speed: Cypress respond to the front-end AJAX requests in hundredths of a second\n\nfront-end testing independence: we test the front-end while developing the front-end, we are no more tied to the back-end so we do not need to delay the front-end testing anymore\n\ntesting confidence: testing the whole front-end in a browser gives you more and more confidence than a JSDom test with the terminal\n\nedge cases replication: with static responses, you can simulate (or reproduce, if you're analyzing a bug) every edge case in a while\n\n\nPleas note an important terminology difference:\n\na stub is a static response used to \"replace\" the server one\n\na mock is a simplified, yet working, version of the back-end. It has the same APIs (from a front-end perspective) but with the minimun complexity neede to simulate the real back-end functionalities\n\n\nImplementing the first UI Integration test\nUntil now, we have tested the registration flow and we have written a custom command to allow every test to consume the front-end with an authenticated user. We are going to analyze the signup flow firstly.\nThe state of the art of our E2E signup flow is the following:\nFile: cypress/integration/examples/signup/signup-8-simpler-assertions.e2e.spec.js\n/// \n\nimport { paths } from \"../../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/App\";\nimport { noArticles } from \"../../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/ArticleList\";\nimport { strings } from \"../../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/Register\";\n\ncontext(\"Signup flow\", () => {\n  it(\"The happy path should work\", () => {\n    const random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100000);\n    const user = {\n      username: `Tester${random}`,\n      email: `user+${random}@realworld.io`,\n      password: \"mysupersecretpassword\"\n    };\n    // set up AJAX call interception\n    cy.server();\n    cy.route(\"POST\", \"**/api/users\").as(\"signup-request\");\n\n    cy.visit(paths.register);\n\n    // form filling\n    cy.findByPlaceholderText(strings.username).type(user.username);\n    cy.findByPlaceholderText(strings.email).type(user.email);\n    cy.findByPlaceholderText(strings.password).type(user.password);\n\n    // form submit...\n    cy.get(\"form\")\n      .within(() => cy.findByText(strings.signUp))\n      .click();\n\n    // ... and AJAX call waiting\n    cy.wait(\"@signup-request\").should(xhr => {\n      expect(xhr.request.body).deep.equal({\n        user: {\n          username: user.username,\n          email: user.email,\n          password: user.password\n        }\n      });\n\n      expect(xhr.status).to.equal(200);\n\n      cy.wrap(xhr.response.body)\n        .should(\"have.property\", \"user\")\n        .and(\n          user =>\n            expect(user)\n              .to.have.property(\"token\")\n              .and.to.be.a(\"string\").and.not.to.be.empty\n        )\n        .and(\"deep.include\", {\n          username: user.username.toLowerCase(),\n          email: user.email\n        });\n    });\n\n    // end of the flow\n    cy.findByText(noArticles).should(\"be.visible\");\n  });\n});\n\nnow, we need to transform it into a UI Integration test, the steps are:\n\nwe do not need a random user anymore. We randomized the user data to improve the test determinism and to avoid to register the same user twice\n\n-const random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100000);\nconst user = {\n- username: `Tester${random}`,\n+ username: \"Tester\",\n- email: `user+${random}@realworld.io`,\n+ email: \"user@realworld.io\",\n  password: \"mysupersecretpassword\"\n};\n\n\nwe need to instrument Cypress to intercept every AJAX request and respond with a static response. We use another feature of the cy.route command, introduced with the Waiting for an AJAX request chapter: passing a response\n\n-cy.route(\"POST\", \"**/api/users\").as(\"signup-request\");\n+cy.route(\"POST\", \"**/api/users\", {\n+ user: {\n+   username: \"Tester\",\n+   email: \"user@realworld.io\",\n+   token:\n+     \"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6IjVkN2ZhZjc4YTkzNGFiMDRhZjRhMzE0MCIsInVzZXJuYW1lIjoidGVzdGVyNzk1MzYiLCJleHAiOjE1NzM4MzY2ODAsImlhdCI6MTU2ODY0OTA4MH0.zcHxMz2Vx5h-EoiUZlRyUw0z_A_6AIZ0LzQgROvsPqw\"\n+ }\n+}).as(\"signup-request\");\n\nwhere does the {user: {...}} response come from? From inspecting the response of the back-end to the POST JAJAX call to the /api/users API\n\n\nwe need to stub (the process of intercepting and responding with static data) even more AJAX calls because, once the signup flow is complete, the home page calls some more APIs to populate the page.\n\n\n    \n\n\nThe test Runner helps us a lot identifying the unstubbed AJAX calls\n\n    \n\n\nas you can see:\n\nthe first AJAX call is a POST to /api/users, it's stubbed and the alias is signup-request\nthe second AJAX call is a GET to /api/tags and it's unstubbed (it hits the back-end application)\nthe third AJAX call is a GET to /api/articles/feed and it's unstubbed\n\nThe Test Runner is a precious ally while trying to understand why the front-end behaves an unexpected way...\nWe can stub both the second and the third AJAX calls with\ncy.route(\"GET\", \"**/api/tags\", { tags: [] }).as(\"tags\");\ncy.route(\"GET\", \"**/api/articles/feed**\", {\n  articles: [],\n  articlesCount: 0\n}).as(\"feed\");\n\n\nwe do not need to check the AJAX response payload anymore (since it's Cypress that responds in place of the back-end app)\n\n-expect(xhr.status).to.equal(200);\n\n-cy.wrap(xhr.response.body)\n- .should(\"have.property\", \"user\")\n- .and(\n-   user =>\n-     expect(user)\n-       .to.have.property(\"token\")\n-       .and.to.be.a(\"string\").and.not.to.be.empty\n- )\n- .and(\"deep.include\", {\n-   username: user.username.toLowerCase(),\n-   email: user.email\n- });\n\n\nwe should wait for the two AJAX calls\n\ncy.wait(\"@signup-request\")\n.should(xhr =>\n  expect(xhr.request.body).deep.equal({\n    user: {\n      username: user.username,\n      email: user.email,\n      password: user.password\n    }\n  })\n)\n+.wait([\"@tags\", \"@feed\"]);\n\nAnd we're done!

Leveraging the fact that the requests do not hit the back-end, we are going to use this kind of tests for a lot of different paths. Some of these paths will not have a corresponding E2E test because they would be too much expensive. Since request payloads are super important, we can not think to check only the ones included in an E2E test.\nA good case to think about is a searchable list, we are going to have probably ten/twenty UI Integration tests (with different request payloads) for it but just two or three E2E tests.\nAuthor: Stefano Magni\n"},"book/fixtures.html":{"url":"book/fixtures.html","title":"Fixtures","keywords":"","body":"Fixtures\nIn the signup-1.integration.spec.js test, every back-end stub has the response set inline, like the api/users stub\ncy.route(\"POST\", \"**/api/users\", {\n  user: {\n    username: \"Tester\",\n    email: \"user@realworld.io\",\n    token:\n      \"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6IjVkN2ZhZjc4YTkzNGFiMDRhZjRhMzE0MCIsInVzZXJuYW1lIjoidGVzdGVyNzk1MzYiLCJleHAiOjE1NzM4MzY2ODAsImlhdCI6MTU2ODY0OTA4MH0.zcHxMz2Vx5h-EoiUZlRyUw0z_A_6AIZ0LzQgROvsPqw\"\n  }\n}).as(\"signup-request\");\n\nbut we can leverage the Cypress fixtures and move the responses out of the test code.\nThe steps are straightforward:\n\ncreate a file in the cypress/fixtures directory, ex. cypress/fixtures/users/signup.json\n\nmove the above response inside it (transforming it into a valid JSON)\n\n\nFile: cypress/fixtures/users/signup.json\n{\n  \"user\": {\n    \"username\": \"tester\",\n    \"email\": \"user@realworld.io\",\n    \"token\": \"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6IjVkN2ZiNmVhZDkzZWQ5MDhiMGU3MDMzYiIsInVzZXJuYW1lIjoidGVzdGVyIiwiZXhwIjoxNTczODM4NTg3LCJpYXQiOjE1Njg2NTA5ODd9.jeAccqZi6dOqokwjRPFl4fzHE5s5p8sB32NgXwlgrxQ\"\n  }\n}\n\n\nreplace the static response of the code with \"fixture:users/signup\", Cypress looks for the users/signup.json file starting from the cypress/fixture directory\n\n-cy.route(\"POST\", \"**/api/users\", {\n- user: {\n-   username: \"Tester\",\n-   email: \"user@realworld.io\",\n-   token:\n      \"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6IjVkN2ZhZjc4YTkzNGFiMDRhZjRhMzE0MCIsInVzZXJuYW1lIjoidGVzdGVyNzk1MzYiLCJleHAiOjE1NzM4MzY2ODAsImlhdCI6MTU2ODY0OTA4MH0.zcHxMz2Vx5h-EoiUZlRyUw0z_A_6AIZ0LzQgROvsPqw\"\n- }\n-).as(\"signup-request\");\n+cy.route(\"POST\", \"**/api/users\", \"fixture:users/signup\").as(\"signup-request\");\n\n\ndo the same for the **/api/tags and **/api/articles/feed** stub\n\nFile: cypress/fixtures/tags/empty-tags.json\n{ \"tags\": [] }\n\nFile: cypress/fixtures/articles/empty-articles.json\n{ \"articles\": [], \"articlesCount\": 0 }\n\n-cy.route(\"GET\", \"**/api/tags\", { tags: [] }).as(\"tags\");\n-cy.route(\"GET\", \"**/api/articles/feed**\", { articles: [], articlesCount: 0 }).as(\"feed\");\n+cy.route(\"GET\", \"**/api/tags\", \"fixture:tags/empty-tags\").as(\"tags\");\n+cy.route(\"GET\", \"**/api/articles/feed**\", \"fixture:articles/empty-articles\").as(\"feed\");\n\nThe result is the same but the test code is way cleaner!\nFile: cypress/integration/examples/signup-integration/signup-2.integration.spec.js\n/// \n\nimport { paths } from \"../../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/App\";\nimport { noArticles } from \"../../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/ArticleList\";\nimport { strings } from \"../../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/Register\";\n\ncontext(\"Signup flow\", () => {\n  it(\"The happy path should work\", () => {\n    const user = {\n      username: \"Tester\",\n      email: \"user@realworld.io\",\n      password: \"mysupersecretpassword\"\n    };\n\n    // set up AJAX call interception\n    cy.server();\n    cy.route(\"POST\", \"**/api/users\", \"fixture:users/signup\").as(\"signup-request\");\n    cy.route(\"GET\", \"**/api/tags\", \"fixture:tags/empty-tags\").as(\"tags\");\n    cy.route(\"GET\", \"**/api/articles/feed**\", \"fixture:articles/empty-articles\").as(\"feed\");\n\n    cy.visit(paths.register);\n\n    // form filling\n    cy.findByPlaceholderText(strings.username)\n      .type(user.username)\n      .findByPlaceholderText(strings.email)\n      .type(user.email)\n      .findByPlaceholderText(strings.password)\n      .type(user.password);\n\n    // form submit...\n    cy.get(\"form\")\n      .within(() => cy.findByText(strings.signUp))\n      .click();\n\n    // ... and AJAX call waiting\n    cy.wait(\"@signup-request\")\n      .should(xhr =>\n        expect(xhr.request.body).deep.equal({\n          user: {\n            username: user.username,\n            email: user.email,\n            password: user.password\n          }\n        })\n      )\n      .wait([\"@tags\", \"@feed\"]);\n\n    // end of the flow\n    cy.findByText(noArticles).should(\"be.visible\");\n  });\n});\n\nAuthor: Stefano Magni\n"},"book/integration-custom-command.html":{"url":"book/integration-custom-command.html","title":"Custom command","keywords":"","body":"Custom command\nThe same way we have created a custom signup command for the E2E tests, we could create an authentication command for the UI Integration Tests too.

So, once we installed our extensions of choice, we can use them in every project!\nThe only thing we have to do to get the React DevTools working is adding the following snippet to the public/index.html of your create-react-app project\n\n  if (window.Cypress) {\n    window[\"__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__\"] =\n      window.parent[\"__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__\"];\n  }\n\n\nthe snippet is needed because the React app runs inside an iframe when launched under Cypress.\nAbout the Chrome DevTools console: to access the global scope of your app you need to change the JavaScript context in the upper-left corner of the console itself. See the next screenshot where window.appActions (defined during the App Actions chapter) becomes available only after a context selection.\n\nTo avoid going back and forth from the code test to exclude/select the tests: we could add the cypress-skip-and-only-ui plugin that adds some buttons to the Test Runner. These buttons allow us to run only a test, to skip some tests or to restore the standard order of the tests. It does, through some simple buttons, what we usually do manually adding .only or .skip to the tests.\n\n    \n\n\nWith all the above tips you discover a new way of working... And you discover that cy.findByPlaceholderText(\"Username\").type(\"Foo\") is way faster than your manually typing. And when you finish... You have already written the tests!\nPlease note: this is not TDD! We have just talked about how to leverage a testing tool to improve our productivity but the aim is not to start TDDing. You should forget about TDD until you are a practiced testing-developer and you work in a team/company that creates the right environment for an approach like that.\nAuthor: Stefano Magni\n"},"book/dedicated-scripts.html":{"url":"book/dedicated-scripts.html","title":"Dedicated scripts","keywords":"","body":"Dedicated scripts\nIf you respect a naming convention like the one proposed earlier that was something like cypress/integration//..spec.js (where TYPEOFTEST is integration, e2e, etc.) is easy to create dedicated scripts for each kind of tests.\nIt could be helpful even for other members of the team: imagine a back-ender that is going to release an update and want to run just the E2E tests locally to be sure that everything works as expected, a npm run tests:e2e script could be helpful for him.

Take a look at the next test\ncontext(\"Signup flow\", () => {\n  it(\"The happy path should work\", () => {\n    // it allows you to manage manually the front-end clock, see the `cy.tick` call\n    cy.clock();\n\n    // ... the rest of the test\n\n    // form submit...\n    cy.get(\"form\")\n      .within(() => cy.findByText(strings.signUp))\n      .click();\n\n    // moves forward the browser clock by 2 seconds\n    cy.tick(2000);\n\n    cy.getByText(\"Please, be patient...\").should(\"be.visible\");\n  });\n});\n\nThe above test does not wait for two seconds (a giant wasted amount of time) until the \"Please, be patient...\" text appears.

Another important aspect is the visual contract. We implement a visual design system and we do our best to get every view conformed with it.\nA lot of concerns come from testing the visual aspect of a front-end application. Pixel-by-pixel comparisons are heavy, slow and not reliable most of the times, why?\n\nvisual regression tests are obviously based on image comparisons: we need to make a screenshot of \"a page\" and compare it with the previous screenshot. That's not an easy task, there are tons of NPM modules that do it for us but...\n\nbut they're slow, taking and comparing 50/100 screenshots could take minutes\n\nthe confidence they give is relative, a lot of times they give false negatives. You usually set a \"tolerance\" ratio that does not care if, for example, \"less than 2% of the pixels are different\". Why do you need to set it? Well, take a look at the next image\n\n\n\nthe image in the center highlights the difference, in terms of changed pixels, between the two images... Just for a browser update...\n\nthe same way we write a lot of different tests, we need to visually test a lot of different tools/pages/views (think about the whole app and every Storybook story for example)\n\nwe need to test a lot of different browsers: if a lot of times the functional (JavaScript) features do not need to be tested on different browsers, we cannot say the same for the visual (CSS) aspect. Different browser render different things, this gets the visual testing harder\n\n\nIt all depends on your needs, there are a lot of manual-triggered solutions (like the StoryShots addon for Storybook or the image-snapshot plugin for Cypress) but the suggestion is to leverage professional services like Percy and Applitools. You need to face the limits of non-professional tools so early that it's hard to tell if they worth a try.\nProfessional and dedicated tools are not free but they simplify your life, they:\n\ncan be integrated into your existing stack\n\nprovide you a nice UI to perform visual testing\n\nprovide cross-browser support\n\nmanage automatically and smartly the little differences to avoid false negatives\n\nmove the workload on their servers instead of your local machine\n\n\nIf you want see how a professional tool could help you with Visual Regression Testing, see the Writing Tests For CSS Is Possible!

Cypress is fast if it's opened but if you need to run all the tests together you have to wait minutes, not seconds nor tenth of seconds\n\nso high-level tests can tell you what did not work but usually, they cannot tell you why.

But he/she is not the only one! All the components and the functions are consumed by the developer, not by the end-user. Every unit of the project has some APIs (its contract) and they need to be tested too. Testing an end-user flow does not allow you to replicate all the API cases\n\neverything is integrated to compose the final application, but you need to test littler integrations to have the confidence you need\n\n\nObviously, it all depends on the project size.

It depends in what you are trying to accomplish, these libraries differ in both technical implementations and philosoph.\nreact-test-renderer\nreact-test-renderer focuses on testing the representation of a React application tree and is not tied to any particular environment. While this allows making assertions without depending on the DOM or other native environments, the surface of uses for a normal React web-app is very small. For instance: it's impossible to test user interaction and events.\nEnzyme\nEnzyme has been the de-facto standard for Component testing for years, it provides ways to test components in isolation and make expectations on the internal states of components and prop passing. While very powerful, the provided APIs are so much to become easily overwhelming to even test the simplest cases.In many cases, testing the internals of the components had the side effect of making tests very fragile, subjective, and with high cost of tests maintenance. At the time of writing, it looks like the community is slowly moving toward testing the end result of React components rather than their internal implementation.\nReact Test Utilities\nreact-dom/test-utils offers a set of utilities to interact with the DOM generated by ReactDOM, allowing to test the closest thing to the user, the HTML generated by ReactDOM.\nReact Testing Library\nreact-testing-library is based on ReactDOM and is focused on testing the generated markup instead of the component internals. In this course we will focus on using this library as we share the values and principle it is based upon \"test your program as close as how your user would\".\nOther technique worth mentioning\nShallow rendering\nShallow rendering is a partial render of a component (his children are not rendered).\nSnapshot testing\nSnapshot testing (not to be confused with screenshot testing) is a technique based on saving to a file the result of a test the first time it runs (the generated HTML for React Components) and for every consequent run, the new result is compared to the previous one saved in the file as a text diff.\nCan we use different testing tools in the same project?\nYes, they serve different purposes and can even be used together in the same file.\nAuthor: Jaga Santagostino\n"},"book/intro-to-react-testing/":{"url":"book/intro-to-react-testing/","title":"What you will learn","keywords":"","body":"What you will learn\nIn this section, we will discuss the basics of testing React components using Jest and ReactDOM:\n\nHow to render a React application for testing\nHow to simulate user events such as clicks\nHow to test a stateful class component\nHow to test a component that uses useState hook\nHow to test a component that uses useEffect hook\nHow to make an assertion on DOM elements status such as being disabled\nHow to check that a DOM element is present (or not) in the DOM\nHow to register custom matchers globally using Jest setup files\nHow to check that a DOM element is visible (or not) to the final user\n\nAuthor: Jaga Santagostino\n"},"book/intro-to-react-testing/setup.html":{"url":"book/intro-to-react-testing/setup.html","title":"Setup","keywords":"","body":"Setup create-react-app\ncreate-react-app offers an out-of-the-box experience when using Jest and React, it's already configured to allow tests to be written in ES6 and use JSX.\nCreate the application\nnpx create-react-app react-testing\ncd react-testing\n\nRun the tests\nnpm test\n\nnote: projects created using create-react-app run Jest in watch mode by default when running npm test\n\nwhen the Jest cli starts press a to run all tests\nin this case, create-react-app provides a single smoke test that checks that the application renders into the DOM without crashing\n\nnote: this is called a 'smoke test', a test where nothing, in particular, is being tested and we make sure that something is not noticeable broken (eg. if there are not smoke odds are it is not burning &#x1F525;)\n\nAuthor: Jaga Santagostino\n"},"book/intro-to-react-testing/react-dom-test-utils.html":{"url":"book/intro-to-react-testing/react-dom-test-utils.html","title":"react-dom-test-utils","keywords":"","body":"Testing with ReactDOM\nUsing React DOM for testing means rendering you React application the same way we render it in a real browser, by calling ReactDOM.render with two arguments, a React.Element (made directly by JSX in most cases) and a node where to mount the application.

The example above works for a simple scenario but if the component had an event handler declared it would not work.\nThe correct way is:\n\nwhen we want to render a component\ncreate a container div\nappend this div to document.body\n\n\nwhen we completed the test\nunmount the react application\nclean the DOM\n\n\n\nDoing this inside every test would be not practical or fun, we can use Jest beforeEach and afterEach utilities to make it simpler:\n  import React from 'react'\n  import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'\n\n+ let container = null\n+ beforeEach(() => {\n+   // setup a DOM element as a render target\n+   container = document.createElement('div')\n+   document.body.appendChild(container)\n+ })\n+\n+ afterEach(() => {\n+   // cleanup on exiting\n+   ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode(container)\n+   container.remove()\n+   container = null\n+ })\n\n  const App = () => Hello!\n\n  test('render app', () => {\n    const container = document.createElement('div')\n    ReactDOM.render(, container)\n\n    expect(container.querySelector('h1').textContent).toBe('Hello!')\n  })\n\nThe beforeEach call creates a new container each time and appends it to document.body. The afterEach call will call ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode(container) which will trigger the unmount of components and all componentWillUnmount liecycle hooks, removes the container from the DOM and set the variable back to null. Please note that setting the container variable to null should not be necessary due to beforeEach overriding it again, but this is to make sure nobody can read the state of the DOM.\nTesting a stateful component\n/* ######## setup code above ######## */\n\nclass Button extends React.Component {\n  state = {\n    value: 0,\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        \n          value: {this.state.value}\n        \n        \n            this.setState(state => {\n              return { value: state.value + 1 }\n            })\n          }\n        >\n          increment\n        \n      \n    )\n  }\n}\n\ntest('stateful button', () => {\n  ReactDOM.render(, container)\n\n  const value = document.getElementById('value')\n\n  expect(value.textContent).toBe('0')\n\n  const button = document.querySelector('button')\n  button.dispatchEvent(new MouseEvent('click', { bubbles: true }))\n  expect(value.textContent).toBe('1')\n})\n\nInteracting with the button\nreact-dom offers a set of utilities found in the package react-dom/test-utils to help to interact with the React applications in a DOM environment (eg. simulating user actions).

Let's speak about act.\nact\nIn order for components that use useEffect and other hooks to work properly in a testing environment we have to use un utility called act: import { act } from 'react-dom/test-utils\n\nWhen writing UI tests, tasks like rendering, user events, or data fetching can be considered as “units” of interaction with a user interface. React provides a helper called act() that makes sure all updates related to these “units” have been processed and applied to the DOM before you make any assertions: react-documentation\n\nUsage:\nact(() => {\n  // anything that causes a component to render/rerender\n})\n// make assertions\n\nwe need to wrap every interactions and operations that cause a component to render or rerender inside act to make it behave as it would in a real application\nact(() => {\n  ReactDOM.render(, container)\n})\n\nNow we can fix the test using act. In our failing example, we can wrap ReactDOM.render and the click simulations into act to see the test passing\n/* ######## setup code above ######## */\n\n  function Button() {\n    const [value, setValue] = React.useState(0)\n\n    React.useEffect(() => {\n      document.title = value\n    }, [value])\n\n    return (\n      \n        \n          value: {value}\n        \n         setValue(value + 1)}>increment\n      \n    )\n  }\n\n  test('stateful button', () => {\n-   ReactDOM.render(, container)\n+   act(() => {\n+     ReactDOM.render(, container)\n+   })\n\n    const value = document.getElementById('value')\n\n    expect(value.textContent).toBe('0')\n    expect(document.title).toBe('0')\n\n    const button = document.querySelector('button')\n\n-   Simulate.click(button)\n+   act(() => {\n+     Simulate.click(button)\n+   })\n\n    expect(value.textContent).toBe('1')\n+   expect(document.title).toBe('1')\n  })\n\nIf you run the button in a real application. the browser will show the component working as intended with the tab's title updating according to the button clicks.\nact must be used multiple times in case of multiple interactions, take a look at the code of the test if you want to add one more feature, like allow clicking up to a max number.\n  //\n  // NEW TASK: allowing the counter only increase\n  // up to a given number\n  //\n  // example \n  // after the counter has reach 2 the button should be disabled\n  //\nwe have been given a new feature to implement in our button.\n/* ######## setup code above ######## */\n\n- function Button() {\n+ function Button({ max }) {\n    const [value, setValue] = React.useState(0)\n\n    React.useEffect(() => {\n      document.title = value\n    }, [value])\n\n    return (\n      \n        \n          value: {value}\n        \n-        setValue(value + 1)}>increment\n+        {\n+           if (value \n+         increment\n+       \n      \n    )\n  }\n\n  test('stateful button', () => {\n+   const max = 2\n    act(() => {\n-     ReactDOM.render(, container)\n+     ReactDOM.render(, container)\n    })\n\n    const value = document.getElementById('value')\n\n    expect(value.textContent).toBe('0')\n    expect(document.title).toBe('0')\n\n    const button = document.querySelector('button')\n+   expect(button.hasAttribute('disabled')).toBe(false)\n\n    act(() => {\n      Simulate.click(button)\n    })\n+   act(() => {\n+     Simulate.click(button)\n+   })\n+   act(() => {\n+     Simulate.click(button)\n+   })\n\n-   expect(value.textContent).toBe('1')\n+   expect(value.textContent).toBe('2')\n+   expect(button.hasAttribute('disabled')).toBe(true)\n  })\n\nAuthor: Jaga Santagostino\n"},"book/intro-to-react-testing/jest-dom.html":{"url":"book/intro-to-react-testing/jest-dom.html","title":"jest-dom","keywords":"","body":"jest-dom\njest-dom is a library that extends Jest using custom matchers in order to make assertions on DOM elements easier.\nUtilities\nAll the utilities offered by jest-dom as matchers\n\ntoBeDisabled\ntoBeEnabled\ntoBeEmpty\ntoBeInTheDocument\ntoBeInvalid\ntoBeRequired\ntoBeValid\ntoBeVisible\ntoContainElement\ntoContainHTML\ntoHaveAttribute\ntoHaveClass\ntoHaveFocus\ntoHaveFormValues\ntoHaveStyle\ntoHaveTextContent\ntoHaveValue\n\nSetup\n\nFirst, you need to install it with npm install --save-dev @testing-library/jest-dom\nthen, add import '@testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect' at the top of every file to register the matchers (or in a setup file loaded by Jest if you prefer to only import it once.

will import from @testing-library/react instead of @testing-library/dom.\nQueries\nthe main concept of dom-testing-library are queries, a set of utilities to find elements in the DOM. The queries are divided into three categories with different features, each category offers the same query in two versions, to query a single element and to query all matching elements.\ngetBy queries\ngetBy* queries return the first matching node found\nand have two important features\n\nthrow an error if no elements match (allow to make expectations without using expect directly)\nthrow if more than one match is found (use getAllBy* queries if you expect more elements matching).\n\nAn example:\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport { render } from \"@testing-library/react\";\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    \n      Hello!\n    \n  );\n}\n\ntest(\"render app\", () => {\n  const { getByText } = render();\n\n  getByText(\"Hello!\");\n});\n\nqueryBy queries\nqueryBy* queries return the first matching node found, and return null if no elements match (like document.querySelector). This is useful for asserting that an element is not present in the document.\nRemember that they throws if more than one match is found (use queryAllBy* queries instead).\nAn example:\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport { render } from \"@testing-library/react\";\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    \n      Hello!\n    \n  );\n}\n\ntest(\"render app\", () => {\n  const { queryByText } =

return a promise which resolves when an element is found which matches the given query\n\nwill reject after 4500 ms is no matches occur\nis the combination of getBy and the utility

react-testing-library testing components using React Context is no different than testing any other kind of component.\nSince we are testing the generated HTML and not how is it generated, the fact that something happens thanks to using React Context is an implementation detail we should not be interested in.\nAll we have to do is to wrap the tested component inside the Context.Provider, exactly as you would in a normal application.\nFor example, a component that uses react-intl can be tested like this\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport { FormattedMessage } from \"react-intl\";\n\nexport function UnreadMessages({ unreadCount }) {\n  return (\n    \n      \n    \n  );\n}\n\nNormal usage\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom\";\nimport { UnreadMessages } from

message\");\n});\n\nDealing with multiple contexts\nSometimes may not be practical to use the provider directly. For example, if the provider requires a setup involving complex props or we have a high number of providers. In such cases a common approach is to create a testing utility that wraps render with all the providers you use in your app\nfunction renderWithProviders(ui, { reduxState, locale = \"en\" }) {\n  const store = createStore(reducer, reduxState || initialState);\n  return (\n    \n      \n        {ui}\n      \n    \n  );\n}\n\n\nnote: to avoid duplication, you can create a single  with all the providers you need and ues it both in testing and React app easily.\n\nAuthor: Jaga Santagostino\n"},"book/react-testing-library/redux.html":{"url":"book/react-testing-library/redux.html","title":"Testing components using Redux","keywords":"","body":"Testing Redux\nTo test components that use Redux is necessary to wrap them component being tested with the store provider.\nFor the next examples we expect to have a working app created using create-react-app already in place.\nSetup\nnpm install redux-starter-kit react-redux\nFiles\nHeader.js\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport { useSelector } from \"react-redux\";\n\nexport function Header() {\n  const user = useSelector(state => state.user);\n\n  if (!user) {\n    return (\n      \n        login\n        register\n      \n    );\n  }\n\n  return {user.name};\n}\n\nreducer.js\nexport const initialState = {\n  user: null\n};\n\nexport function reducer(state = initialState, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case \"LOGIN\":\n      return {\n        ...state,\n        user: action.payload.user\n      };\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n}\n\nHeader.test.js\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport { Provider } from \"react-redux\";\nimport { Header } from \"./Header\";\nimport { createStore } from \"redux\";\nimport { initialState, reducer } from \"./reducer\";\nimport { render } from \"@testing-library/react\";\n\nfunction renderWithProviders(ui, { reduxState } = {}) {\n  const store = createStore(reducer, reduxState || initialState);\n  return render({ui});\n}\n\ntest(\"header not logged in\", () => {\n  const { getByText } = renderWithProviders(, {\n    store: { user: null }\n  });\n  getByText(\"login\");\n  getByText(\"register\");\n});\n\ntest(\"header logged in\", () => {\n  const { getByText } = renderWithProviders(, {\n    reduxState: {\n      user: {\n        name: \"bob\"\n      }\n    }\n  });\n\n  getByText(\"bob\");\n});\n\nAuthor: Jaga Santagostino\n"},"book/resources.html":{"url":"book/resources.html","title":"Resources","keywords":"","body":"Resources\nWatch the videos of the tests of this project directly into the Cypress Dashboard (GitHub/Google sign in required).\n\nCypress Docs\n\nE2E testing Best Practices\nRecipes\nRetry-ability\nThe Test Runner\nGitHub Integration\nNetwork Requests\nCode Coverage\n\nArticles\n\nStefano Magni: Test the request and response payloads\nKent C.
